## Section 2: Establishing the problem ##
### The idea validation framework ###
1. How does it work?
	1. Spray and pray
		1. Everybody is fallible - We need to test it if it is or not high quality
		2. Works for mobile app or web app (anything online)
2. Steps:
	1. **Come up with hypothesis**
		1. Idea + Business problem in one sentence
			1. Costco: Customers are willing to purchase at larger quantities if they can purchase at a lower price per unit.
			2. Facebook: An online platform where people could share public information and communicate between each other
		2. Boil down an idea into a sentence:
			1. **What, then why, and then how**
				1. It is going to change as we get feedback
					1. When we realize that we are onto something but we are missing the point
						1. Change it but retain little bit of nugget of whatever you have established in the beginning (it's a pivot)
	2. **Design a pitch experiment**
		1. Pitching it to someone online like it is real and seeing how they respond
			1. How to run it?
				1. Do some background work - qualitative analysis
					1. For people who have little bit of idea and not sure which direction to go with it and they need to do more background thought before they establish what they want to setup for an experiement
					2. It is quantity over quality experiment
						1. It is better to try it multiple times than to just sit there and think in your head and get the perfect idea
							1. Problem otherwise: We are not exposing the idea to other people's opinions (we don't know how people react). We are not validating the idea
								1. We are not introducing new information or new tests
									1. It's a humbling experience
						2. Focusing on quantity
							1. We can angle the business in different ways
								1. Changing based on customer segment
								2. Changing the product to sell to the same people
							2. Test multiple things and do it in rapid succession
								1. Feedback might be incomplete, inconclusive, or not satisfied with the response
									1. Start over, introduce new concepts, new ideas, tweaking it using the feedback
								2. Everything can be done in 2 hours
									1. Easy, repeatable process
					3. Minimum criteria for success
						1. Approximately, I say that this idea is proven if I get a certain reaction
							1. Metric:
								1. Email validation - 70% responses from people saying they like the idea (a bar)
									1. It is considered a popular idea
				2. Manually similate the process
					1. Concierge service
						1. Example: Wordpress design described as text
							1. We need to handle all the emails in the background...

### The idea we're going to use as an example ###
1. Example idea
	1. Mobile app
		1. Look around the area and know happy hours in the area
			1. Cheap
			2. Don't know who has it
2. Test it
	1. **Get it outside your head**

### Customer segmentation ###
1. What is it?
	1. Think about who is going to use our app, product, or website
		1. Who is going to benefit from it
		2. Who has a problem that this solution is solving
	2. Identify the exact problem
		1. We probably had a problem and thought of an idea to solve it
			1. How?
				1. Think of a service and think backwards. What value is the service going to give? What problem is being solved?
					1. Is it a problem?
					2. Is it a convenience?
						1. It can be framed as a problem
		2. Example: Outlet for getting information for happy hours. However, there is not a good way to get that information (what's in the area, what's available, what are the specials)
			1. Alternatives: Yelp - not very good for searching for happy hours
	3. Define potential customer groups - who is going to benefit from the service
		1. Get specific
			1. Demographics
			2. Ages 
			3. Associations they have
			4. Criteria they could potentially have
		2. **Take the group that has the hardest time with the problem we have established and go after those people**
			1. Rank the customers
				1. Rank those groups based on need (who suffers the most to who suffers the least)
					1. If it is double sided, do it from both sides
						1. Restaurants
						2. Customers
				2. Example: 
					1. 21-37 olds
					2. Couples
					3. Groups sponsoring events - organization groups
						1. Meetups
						2. Hobby groups
						3. ...
			2. Rank the suppliers
				1. Small restaurants
					1. Larger restaurants have better reach
					2. No ad budget
					3. No large facebook pages
					4. ...
				2. New restaurants
					1. No clientale base
				3. Clubs
					1. Between 5-8 they don't find people
				4. **Ranking is for prioritization & feedback**
					1. We might find that the group may not be facing as much problem or another group might be facing more problems
						1. Feedback tells whether our assumption was correct or not
			3. Customer side
				1. Organization groups - in terms of pain
					1. Repeatable especially after work
				2. 21-30 years olds
					1. If looking quickly
				3. Couples on a date
					1. Not high priority
			4. Business side:
				1. Small restaurants
					1. They are small and make money off of happy hours
					2. They have small budgets
				2. New restaurants
					1. Problem goes away as they get clients
				3. Clubs
					1. Not every club has happy hours
					2. Could cause a branding issue

### Running a qualitative analysis offline ###
1. Gathering problem based feedback
	1. Which customer group has the biggest problem we are trying to solve
		1. Take the list
		2. **Look for people to talk to**
			1. **Reach out to immediate network**
				1. People you know
					1. Even on social media
						1. **Incentivise people to talk to you for 5-10 minutes**
							1. Coffee
							2. Lunch
							3. Order something
							4. ...
				2. Do it on phone - faster
			2. **Ask your clients**
				1. They are interested in meeting with you as long as it is around something that makes your experience better
					1. **If they are interested in a product or feature in a product, they will be willing to talk to you**
						1. Good if we have prior relationship with them
						2. Feedback from them is good - more honest
			3. **Ask your users**
				1. Look at top 10 users, 100 users, power users and ask them to talk to you
				2. Incentivise them
					1. Amazon gift card
					2. Pro-feature
					3. ...
			4. **Ask potential customers**
				1. Look for people offline - if no network
					1. Cold context
						1. Businesses - Go on Yelp
							1. Email the business - response rate is lower
								1. Solution: Email a larger group of people for the response you want
									1. 2-3 people per segment is fine
							2. You want someone who responds with a paragraph and not just a sentence
		3. **Frame your questions carefully**
			1. Don't lead them to your question
				1. Don't subconsciously include answers in your own questions
					1. Is this a good service? - clean
					2. This is a good service, isn't it? - not clean
						1. Doesn't allow freedom of expression
				2. Solution: **Ask open-ended questions**
					1. Tell them it is very important to you
					2. Tell them you want to make better products and help the people we know - they would help
					3. We can get a lot more info from them
						1. How, what, why
							1. They must extrapolate and articulate what they are thinking
						2. **Don't try to convince them**
							1. Describe a problem and tell they can benefit from solving it. Is it a problem for you?
								1. You don't have to introduce a solution
						3. **Establish the degree of your problem**
							1. Ask them how much of a problem is it?
								1. If they say it is not a problem, you can still ask to know why it is not a problem
							2. **How do you currently solve the problem?**
								1. Helps us find out how difficult it is for them to solve the problem
									1. Not found a solution?
									2. Is it a complicated process?
						4. **Other common questions**
							1. Would you pay for a service like this?
							2. Would you use the service if it was free?
								1. One side might say they want free version
							3. How do you want my service to be to solve the problem?
								1. They will use it only if it solving a big problem
							4. Do you have any hesitations about the service?
								1. Privacy - geolocation say
								2. Keywords concerned about?
									1. Avoid those words
							5. What does the concept make you think of?
								1. Does it resemble another service?
								2. Is it a bad idea?
					4. Person-to-person gives a rich experience
		4. Reordering your "pain list"
			1. Does it match what was before?
				1. If it doesn't, re-order them
					1. New restaurants have the hardest problem with this
					2. **Target the idea for that segment**
						1. If the idea doesn't work out for the first group, we
							1. Move onto the second group OR
							2. Pivot
								1. **Going after the first group is more effective**
									1. They have the most pain around the problem
										1. They are called "The innovators" group
											1. They are a small group but relate with your idea much more strongly and are much more willing to use your service
												1. Bar for them is much lower
						2. The other groups need much more polished and much more well presented idea
							1. We want to build something that is quick, cheap, and validate quickly
								1. Not build a full featured product
							2. Continue to polish the product and bring in the later stage of consumers (because they expect something much more polished)
						3. The first group gives the maximum foothold
2. If we have only one idea, do with with phone-calls, and in person with network
3. If we have many ideas, we can do it online with tools

### Three practice ideas ###

### Section 2 Review Material ###

## Section 3: Scope out the competition ##
### Search techniques for finding competitors ###
1. Go in depth to look for potential competitor
	1. We need to find them and see how close they are to your idea
	2. Competition could be a good or a bad thing
		1. Competition - Someone else has recognized the problem and trying to find a solution
			1. It might be crowded and difficult, and need more execution ability
		2. If you see it as good
			1. It could be a problem worth solving because there is demand
	3. Look at competition and see if you can beat them or not
		1. See what disadvantages they have
		2. See what they are doing wrong
			1. We can improve on it
		3. If their idea is not the same but similar
			1. If you think you have a better shot at what they are doing, then test
	4. Google:
		1. Rules:
			1. Example: happy hours "itunes" (quotation - searches for just that word and not permutations or combinations)
				1. itunes - app appears in itunes website
				2. There are a few
			2. Example: happy hours play.google
			3. Example: happy hours -yelp (should not give results from yelp)
			4. Example: dropbox vs (competitors will show up)
	5. edit.blekko.com - better for startups - tags listings and moves them to buckets. If we use the group name, searched in the bucket
		1. Example: happy hours app /startups
		2. Example: happy hours app /news (press releases)
			1. We can do frensics - if they existed
	6. Blog specific search engines
		1. Blogs - popular for finding potential competition
			1. They cover other applications
		2. **Blog Search Engine**
			1. Example: happy hours
	7. crunchbase.com
		1. Know about startups which have recieved funding

### Running a competitive analysis ###
1. Analytics tools
	1. Why?
		1. It guides the decision making process
			1. If you are okay with competition, then it is worth knowing about them
				1. What are they doing?
				2. What are they doing right?
				3. Is it active?
				4. Who started it?
				5. Where are they?
				6. Can we partner?
			2. If you are not okay with competition, we are looking for defunct products
				1. They didn't run it well
				2. Something that says there is an opportunity for a new entrant
	2. What can we get?
		1. What are they spending?
		2. Where are they spending?
		3. What press mention do they get?
		4. Are they doing a lot of social media activity?
2. Examples:
	1. GoTime
		1. Niche products have one competitor
		2. Moving to Seattle
		3. Small ideas don't have to blow up and become no one
	2. semrush.com
		1. Free for a day
			1. Put https://www.gotime.com 
				1. Shows statistics - monthly
			2. CPC - How much you will pay per click
				1. Higher the value, more demand it has
					1. Not worth spending
						1. Choose keywords wisely to avoid costs
			3. How many they have identified as competitors
				1. Keyword clusters are taken and compere them with those of other websites - the sites are probably competing
					1. If there is too much overlap, they are related in some way
			4. How many times they are in top 3 search results
			6. How many times they are in 4-10 positions
			7. Number of positions
			8. Position changes
			9. Competitors
			10. Do they show up in:
				1. Display ads

### Using Unbounce for more in-depth analysis ###
1. Use the address to drive traffic
	1. Launchrock has limitations but free and easy to use
		1. We cannot change much
		2. It is harder to get across with plain text and email address

		2. It costs money

### Making the Unbounce page fit our idea ###

6. You need to change the way it looks on mobile phone
7. **We can make multi-variant tests**
	1. We can change text, color, features, etc. and set up multiple variations and test all of them

### Adding conversion goals and dynamic text ###
1. Conversion goals - setting up to see how many people click on the action button to know how many people are interested

			1. Properties
				1. URL - basic HTML with thank you for signing up
	2. Secondary conversion

			2. Repeat until you get a high conversion rate
	3. Change image to cartoon image
	4. Switch sides between text and phone image
