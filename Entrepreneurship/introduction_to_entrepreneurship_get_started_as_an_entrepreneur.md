			1. Optimistic - People who think something good might happen to them in the future (they think they can get over the problems)

### Understanding the business life cycle ###
1. Big picture - macro understanding
2. All businesses have 4 distinctive phases
	1. Helps us understand how businesses transition, how do Entrepreneurial roles within the business transition, how do personalities of Entrepreneurs aid them in each section of the business
3. Business life cycle
	1. Phase #1: Pre-Launch
		1. We haven't built anything
		2. We haven't taken money from anyone
		3. Entrepreneur has spotted an opportunity and planning to tackle the market opportunity
		4. Entrepreneur has gathered resources and not yet started selling anything or bringing any money
		5. They are by themselves, or with co-founder
		6. It is a thought experiment
			1. Research
			2. Figuring out what is available and moving forward
	2. Phase #2: Startup
		1. We are taking everything done in Phase 1 and we start doing it
		2. Bring in first customers & first dollars
		3. We start hiring employees (potentially contractors)
		4. Still a small operation
		5. Entrepreneur is doing a lot of different things
			1. Anything
				1. Answering phones
				2. Doing sales
				3. Doing customer service
				4. ...
			2. It is necessary
				1. Experiencing growing pain
			3. Entrepreneur fits any role depending on what's needed
	3. Phase #3: Growth
		1. What happens after startup phase
			1. 5 to 100, 200, or 1000 people
		2. We usually see an upword trend of revenue, employees, client base
		3. Startups spend a lot of money to bring in clients as soon as possible
			1. To tackle as much of the market share
			2. To tackle as much of the market
		4. Entrepreneur settles in one role
			1. CEO who works with high level executives
			2. Or a position they are more willing to do
	4. Phase #4: Maturity
		1. Potentially decline
		2. Fortune 100, 500, 1000 are in mature stage
			1. Multiple countries, cities, offices
		3. Company is growing but growth rate is slowing down
		4. Decline
			1. Happens after the market is so well developed and saturated that profitability is taken out of the market
				1. Company selling the same product loses sales or profit
					1. Solution: Companies typically try to expand at this point or pivot into something else
						1. Companies do one thing really well, and once that product or service gets mature and decline, they split of and start doing other things simultaneously (smart companies do that - early on in the growth stage)
4. Entrepreneurs are crucial in the first 2 phases, important in the 3rd stage, generally obsolete in the 4th phase
	1. At 4th phase, they leave and do something else and replace themselves with a potential CEO
		1. At the beginning, they are everything and success of the company falls on their back
5. A lot of companies fail in all phases
	1. Even in a mature phase, they don't differentiate themselves, and end up declining into the abyss

### The different types of income ###
1. Active income vs passive income
	1. Active income - something asks us to do something and we do it and get money
		1. If you show up you make money
	2. Passive income - money that's made whether or not there is incremental work being done
		1. How?
			1. Investments - stocks goes up and made money
				1. They didn't show up any single day - no relationship to what happens to the stock
			2. Dividends - investment in utility companies or bonds (every period of time they get a payment - annuity)
				1. Money comes whether we work or not
		2. Entrepreneurs want passive income
			1. Leverage as much as possible
				1. They try to construct companies or value giving vehicles around the concept
					1. Build something (invest in something) and make more money over a long term and have a bigger ratio of passive income to active income
						1. Example: Software company giving subscriptions to a service
							1. We sign up and use a service
								1. No income rental cost to the company for sign up
									1. If many sign up, the company might have to hire one more person (high ratio of passive to active)
										1. Passive - subscriptions (some try 100% passive)
										2. Active - employees
	3. Recurring revenue
		1. Instead of selling something or doing a service and doing once and gathering money only once, users repeatedly pay as long as they use it or are a member (they are part of customer base)
			1. Entrepreneurs try to shoot for products that don't sell only once but sell multiple times
				1. Selling cheaper razers on a subscription instead of selling a razor once for $12
					1. Buy weekly (recurring revenue)
	4. Planned Obsolescence (Re-occuring revenue)
		1. iPad gets slower and seem to have bugs over time

				1. Company breaks the product after year or two

		2. They use an app and request for a service and we get it on demand immediately
	2. Sharing economy business model (or under-utilized assets)
		1. Companies want individual consumers to own things that they can share with people outside of their friends for money
			1. Airbnb
				1. Allows people to rent out their space (like hotel) and charge money for it
			2. Getaround
				1. Rent out your car to anyone
		2. Advantages
			1. Sharing is cheaper - Airbnb is cheaper than hotels (they don't charge as much)
		3. Power drill dilemma
			1. Power drills are $50 to $500
				1. Average time in a year a power drill is used is 14 minutes
					1. Hence it can be rented out for remaining time to recoup the cost (we save money)
	3. Crowdsourcing
		1. Sell something, provide content, or value online and source all the ideas or information from individual people
			1. Example: Teespring
				1. We can buy tee shirts
					1. Individual people design them (a market place)
						1. They become popular and people buy them and person who designed them gets a cut
				2. It is leveraging infinite creativity of everyone and monetizing in the process
			2. They don't come up with products or services themselves
				1. They let anybody else come up with ideas
			3. Derisking what we are trying to sell: If many vote for something or someone designs it themselves, they are taking the risk and pre-validating it (in a group of people), we know it is going to sell or not cost a lot of money (win-win)
	4. Freemium
		1. Mobile apps
			1. We can use many features of the application for free, but we can become a power user by paying
				1. Either time-bound or feature-bound
		2. Examples:
			1. Evernote - For writing notes and storing information, collaborating
				1. Free to use but pay for certain feature set
		3. Idea
			1. If somebody has not used it, it is hard to sell it to them
				1. If people try it, they're much more likely to purchase it
					1. They might get addicted to the service
					2. They might integrate it someway into their life
				2. They are much more likely to pay money and stick through their lifetime
		4. It works when it doesn't cost you anything to give it for free (another version, say)
			1. It is not good for product businesses, but okay for SaaS
				1. Games (business owner - costs nothing)
		5. Free products on the other hand take significant money on our end and potentially lose money because we are paying
	5. Direct to consumer business model
		1. Consider a business sold in retail, large grocery stores, department stores, ... we sell that directly to someone through the internet
			1. Example: Dell Computers
				1. We can only buy them from their website (not Walmart, Best Buy, ...)
					1. They can keep the prices low, because they don't pay any money to the retailers
					2. No dealing with logistics, and shipping it around the world, figure out how many needs to be shipped etc.
				2. Customer approach, buy, and the product is shipped
			2. Example: Warby Parker
				1. Visual simulator to put on the glasses and they are shipped
				2. We can try them for a couple of days and if it is good, we buy them
		2. Delivering convenience (otherwise might require a lot of effort to get the basics done)
	6. Other business models - resources

### Scalability ###
1. What is scalability?
	1. Is it easy to take the business we have conceptualized and grow to 1000s or 100s of 1000s or millions of customers
		1. Does it scale cleanly
		2. Side-businesses are not concerned except a little
		3. Lifestyle businesses are concerned to a medium level
		4. Startup - very important concept
	2. If you cannot scale past a certain point, you have reached a limit
		1. Selling to first customer has unique challenges
		2. Selling to next 10 customers has its own unique challenges
		3. Selling to next 100 or 1000 have their own unique challenges
	3. Example:
		1. Food for 10 people
			1. Make it for 10 people, make it delicious and find a location where you can sell them to 10 people
		2. To sell food to 10k
			1. We need to make a production line to produce them and have enough of it on time so that it doesn't go spoiled
			2. We need to have logistics
			3. We need to have warehousing
			4. We need to have shipping
			5. Taxes
			6. Healthcode
2. How can we tell if a business is scalable?
	1. Does your business have a lot of marginal cost?
		1. Marginal cost - Everything we sell something, how much does it cost us?
			1. For some businesses, it cost a penny but can be sold for $10
			2. For some businesses, it costs $7 but can be sold for $10
		2. SaaS - It doesn't cost anything but server cost and bandwidth
			1. Very scalable
		3. Hard to sell products or services
			1. Painting
				1. Hard to scale - we are core to making the product so cannot clone or duplicate myself
					1. We cannot sell a 1000 of them if we cannot physically make a 1000 of them
	2. Scalability depends on your market
		1. Large markets are easier to scale
		2. Small markets could be a problem
			1. If we are making a vaccine that cures a disease only 10 people have
				1. Not scalable because once we hit 10, we cannot sell anymore
3. Entrepreneurs must worry about the two and take them into consideration
	1. We don't want to sell something that ultimately becomes a burden on myself
		1. Business coaching or lifestyle coaching doesn't scale very well
			1. Each customer needs more time from you
				1. How to make it scalable?
					1. Put all your info and make an online course - marginal cost is very minimal
4. Startups need scalability
	1. If we are not scalable, we cannot grow big
	2. If we don't grow big, we cannot get big investments
	3. Sometimes we need big investments

### Section 5 review material ###
### Quiz 4: Review of core business concepts ###

## Section 6: Validating your idea ##
### What is validation? ###
1. Validation - recent
	1. Essential part of the process
		1. It is how Entrepreneurs figure out before they jump into something, before they spend a lot of time, and money, and marketing about the great idea they have. How do they know whether or not it is going to succeed?
			1. No one know for a fact
				1. But we can do many things that if done well and gives a general indication of whether it will more likely succeed
	2. This step happens between
		1. Noticing the problem, opportunity & conceptuatlization (putting a solution)
	3. It's an optional step
	4. It's becoming the standard
		1. Spending a minimum amount of time testing out or doing basic experiments to see whether there is demand or whether the opportunity is real
	5. Problem solved:
		1. Ideas always sound great in your head, but if you don't get them out in the market, you don't know whether or not they are good.
			1. Erid Ries: "When you're in the shower and we have an idea, boy, does it sound great. But in reality, most of our ideas are actually quite terrible."
				1. True for Entrepreneurs with any experience
	6. Validation is an opportunity to minimize the risk of persuing a venture
		1. Crucial

### Surveys ###
1. Technique for validating business
	1. Conduct a survey
		1. Basic way
		2. Easiest way
		3. Works on: The wisdom of crowds
			1. If ask a question to several people, they are more often than not correct than if you ask one or two
				1. Ask more people about your idea & ask as many people as possible
					1. 100 people can come up with a consensus
		4. Why do you survey?
			1. Survey one or two groups:
				1. People who are in the industry you're targetting (the space we are entering or going after)
					1. They have info that we don't have
					2. They can give judgement about whether or not they could visualize happening and being successful
				2. Potential customers (of product or service)
					1. They might tell you if they personally would purchase our product
		5. When surveying
			1. Tell them why the idea is great - Try to be objective
				1. Don't pitch at them at what you are doing (it's going to be biased. If you already show what you are doing is great, they are much more likely to say yes - skews data. When the actual customers buy it, they don't have the same scenario - Avoid false positives)
					1. Sit, listen and gather as much information about the context of the business idea as much as possible
						1. How to do it?
							1. Lead them into it
								1. **Ask questions about the space & about the problem we are trying to solve**
2. What to ask?
	1. Customers:
		1. Do they have the problem that you're trying to solve?
		2. What solutions the have used to tackle the problem before?
	2. Industry people:
		1. Do they think this problem actually exists?
			1. Did they observe?
		2. Would people pay money for a solution?
3. As a next step:
	1. Then give a solution to the problem and ask if they are enthusiastic about it
		1. Explain your solution objectively (don't give subjective opinions)
	2. How much would they pay for it potentially
4. How to do surveys?
	1. SurveyMoney
	2. AWeber
	3. Google Forms
		1. Spread the link
5. How to find participants for the survey?
	1. Your immediate network (they are easy to get to fill out the survey)
		1. Do you know if there is anyone in the industry?
		2. Do you know if anyone would buy it?
	2. Industry groups, forums, meetings (where people gather and are potentially interested in the solution)
		1. Reddit - giant forum
			1. Subreddits
				1. Pitching business ideas
				2. New Entrepreneurs
				3. SaaS
			2. Tell them we want to validate an idea and solve a problem and we would be very greatful for their time
			3. Try to incentivize them to answer
	3. Make it short - make it as painless as possible
		1. 1/2 page to a full page
6. Service to use:
	1. Ask your target market (aytm)
		1. pay per survey answerer
		2. They deal with finding people & getting them to finish it & make sure they fit the demographics and interests
7. Facebook groups
	1. Start asking questions

### Talking to experts ###
1. Asking experts in the industry we are trying to enter
	1. Experts have experience going into the industry we are trying to enter
	2. Experts have insights and potentially trade secrets or potentially inside information that we otherwise would not have access to
	3. Not everyone is good at seeing whether or not an idea is good but they have more information to pull for so their answers are more accurate
	4. They could know whether the idea has been tried before
	5. They would potentially know if there is a block or barrier that will prevent you from entirely pursuing it
		1. Example an expert might say it is illegal
			1. Example: Selling cars from a website
				1. 48 - 50 states - illegal
					1. US has a law that says you can buy cars only from certified dealers
2. How to contact industry experts
	1. Email
		1. More likely to respond
	2. Phone - a pain for them
	3. In person - most preferred
		1. To get most information
3. Steps:
	1. Identify experts in your area
		1. Search through blog and newscontent - to check if there is anyone who writes on your topic or has written something related to the product, service or industry
			1. use search engines dedicated to blogs or news outlets
	2. Contact them
	3. Show them that you read what they wrote
	4. Present your idea and ask for feedback 
		1. In one or two sentences
		2. If the idea piques their interest, real them in and actually have a conversation
	5. Present your idea and aks for feedback
		1. Say you want to solve a problem and I need 5 minutes of your time
		2. Say: "I am working on this, would you like to know more. I want your thoughts and feedback"
4. Linked In
	1. Search - Based of of hierarchy of their job or specific title they have
		1. Look for space we are going to enter into
			1. If they currently in the space, they could have some information
			2. If they worked in the space previously, they are more likely to divulge information (they are not attached to it anymore)
		2. Look for company with which we are potentially going to compete
	2. Be nice and offer to incentivise them
		1. Buy lunch
		2. Buy coffee
		3. ...
	3. Make sure to convey that we appreciate their time
	4. Industry experts might be busy so we might need to try multiple times
	5. Contact as many industry experts as we can
	6. Ensure we have as many conversations as we can

### The lean startup framework ###
1. Defacto way for startups to tackle business
2. Framework - Lean Startup
	1. We don't know if our idea is good, we only make assumptions (set of assumptions)
	2. Any business idea comes with a set of assumptions
		1. Two ways to tackle the assumptions
			1. Building a solution
				1. Spend money
				2. Spend time
				3. We get feedback
				4. Change the product based off of feedback
			2. The lean startup framework
				1. Do as minimum amount of work as possible to see if the customers use it
				2. Take the feedback and insert it back into the process
				3. Build the product and repeat the above process
				4. It is a system of running rapid experiments
					1. Experiments that give you information (true information that came from customers)
	3. Cycle:
		1. Build - Measure - Learn
			1. Build something
			2. Measure it's success, interaction, how customers react to it, what they use, what they like, what they don't like
			3. We take that information and learn and figure out what we did wrong, make correct, and rebuild and restart the process
	4. Stop making things that people don't want to buy
		1. Saving time and resources
		2. Focus on adapting faster
		3. Get towards the final product that is acceptable and popular and sooner
3. Core concepts
	1. Testing ideas is treated as a scientific experiment
		1. Scientific experiment
			1. Hypothesis
			2. Assumptions
			3. Test criteria
			4. Conclusion
			5. Opinion
		2. Analogy
			1. Hypothesis based off of the business idea
				1. It is idea condensed to one or two sentences
			2. Assumptions
				1. Sentences can include one or more assumptions we are testing along
	2. Example:
		1. Business selling custom T-Shirts
			1. Hypothesis: People are willing to buy custom T-shirts and they have some sort of benefit from wearing them.
				1. Assumption 1: Willing to pay for custom (custom are probably expensive)
					1. We don't know if the assumption is right unless we get out there and try
				2. Assumption 2: There's benefit from it being custom
			2. Validated Learning
				1. Information is validated from a real live experiment and not from 
					1. Market research
					2. Our inclinations or personal beliefs suggest would be
						1. We pushing out conjectures (guessing)
					3. If we try to sell it and someone says, great or we don't like this part, the information is a validated information
				2. Get as much validated learning as we can and incorporate it into the next hypothesis
			3. Pivot (significant turn)
				1. If validated learning is not at all good, we make significant change to the original idea
					1. Changing business model say
					2. Changing name
					3. Changing features
					4. ...
	3. Minimum criteria for success
		1. Before we test our hypothesis, it is always good to set a minimum criteria to judge the hypothesis or test to be true or successful
		2. It is subjective but important
		3. Example:
			1. If I show it to 10 people, I want 8 out of 10 to buy it
	4. Pitch Experiment
		1. A very useful tool to validate potential business idea
	5. **Read the boook**

### Pitch experiments ###
1. Pitch: Pitching business idea to someone
2. Experiment: The one defined by Lean Startup framework
3. Pitch Experiment: Walking up to someone (a friend say) and pitch the business idea.
	1. There is a problem with pitching to friend - biased towards saying it is a good idea (to impress you)
	2. Instead of pitching idea, we **pitch a product you pretend it's real** and pitch it to real customers in real scenarios
		1. Only in the scenario of a real potential customer who does not know you and where they are making a buying decision is when we actually figure out whether or not real customers would buy it
			1. There is not difference between pitching it to them this way for buying it than building the real product and they make a decision to buy it
	3. Example: Test a hypothesis b building a fake landing page
		1. **Pitches the product (fake at this point) as if it is real or it is soon to be real and we see how customers react**
	4. Businesses started like this. Pitched an idea and noticed that it is very popular.
		1. People signed up
		2. People gave them their emails
		3. People acted in a way that gave an idea that people had interest
	5. After they have enough information, they actually built the first version
4. How to do this? (Ther's another course - Idea Validation: From Idea to Paying Customer in One Day)
	1. Steps:
		1. Make a fake page describing what we are going to be selling or what service we are proposing
			1. Tools: Login and use a template. Type some info about what we are doing. Make a sales headline. Make some feature text. Put a fake image that makes them visualize what we are doing.
				1. Squarespace
				2. Wix.com
				3. Wordpress.com
				4. Launchrock
		2. Get people to look at it
			1. Similar to how do we find people for survey
				1. Facebook groups
				2. subreddits
				3. Industry groups
				4. Mailing lists
				5. People in the network
			2. We can send out ads (we can sign up and get coupons for free $50) - Drive traffic to our website
				1. Facebook ads
				2. Google ads
				3. Linked ads
				4. Newer platforms
5. We can use pitch experiments for everything
	1. Unless there is something too complicated
		1. A web application that promises to do certain functions but doesn't yet do it
			1. We don't have to make it real. We can say it is upcoming
				1. Give us your email address and we will email you when it happens (are they interested when it comes out?)
	2. Results: We want potential customers to
		1. Pay us money
		2. Give email address
		3. Signal some form of interest
			1. Clicking on a buy button
			2. Clicking on learn more
			3. ...
	3. If the results meet the minimum criteria, we are good to go
6. Advantages:
	1. Costs almost nothing
	2. Takes an hour or two to prepare a pitch experiment
7. MVP - Next step to validate the idea

### Constructing an MVP ###
1. A technique for validating business idea
2. Crucial to understand Lean Startup framework
3. Concept: MVP - Mininum Viable Product
	1. The absolute minimum amount of effort and resources you have to spend in order to get to a point where you can determine if a customer wants to buy your product
	2. At this point we already know they are going to buy it but show real interest.
	3. MVP can be a pitch experiment
	4. It has more functionality and more to show than a pitch experiment to convince them to buy
	5. Best MVPs have the absolute minimum (no bells and wistles)
		1. A pitch experiment or
		2. First product
4. Example:
	1. Restaurant
		1. MVP - Street car or food truck (not a full-fledged restaurant), a brochure that has menu (to see how many dial in to buy the order)
			1. One item from the menu and take it to a food event or park to see if people would buy it
		2. It costs a fraction as compared to persuing a full restaurant
		3. We just want to see if people are interested in the idea and are ready to pay
	2. Shoes
		1. Zappos
			1. Basic website
			2. Took stores and took photos
			3. They put on website
			4. When cutomers requested, they went to the stores, bought them and shipped them
5. MVP - very basic prototype or first version of what we want to sell
	1. Mobile App
		1. Pick the one feature that can be the most popular or deliver the most value to potential customers
		2. Build it
			1. To save money further
				1. Simulate it (instead of coding it)
					1. It may not even look good
						1. Why would anyone buy something that doesn't look good?
							1. In business there are two kinds of customers
								1. Someone who really want to buy it
									1. Don't care how MVP looks (these people will just pay you and we can re-invest the money to go from here)
									2. If people won't pay for your basic version, the ideas is not good (noone desires it)
								2. Someone who kind of want to buy it
									1. They want it polished
	2. Example:
		1. Website
			1. Use squarespace or Wix and use a template
			2. Drupal or Wordpress - CMS
		2. Online Store
			1. Shopify.com
				1. Store in 10-15 minutes
					1. Fake products
		3. Custom application
			1. Try outsourcing
			2. Take the minimum version we can and hire someone else who is cheap and make a decent job at it
	3. If noone comes forward to buy it, we have saved resources and time

### Section 6 review material ###
### Quiz 5: Validating your ideas ###

## Section 7: Fundraising ##
### Know your options ###
1. Once we have a business idea, how do we get the resources you need?
	1. Options: Major ones
		1. Only one of the funding sources has to work
			1. See what fits you best
		2. Some of the funding sources are tried and true, but some are brand new

### Bootstrapping ###
1. Concept - hear over and over
	1. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps
		1. Pick yourself up on your own without anyone's help
	2. Bootstrapping - do it yourself (fund it yourself)
		1. We did everything we need to get to a point where you make money or you don't need investment anymore
		2. Most businesses get bootstrapped up to a certain point
			1. It is very hard to raise money on just an idea unless we know really rich people who owe us a favor
		3. How far can you go with bootstrapping?
			1. If less money, we can go pretty far and switch into another fundraising techniqe
		4. How do Entrepreneurs bootstrap and what techniques they use?
			1. Things to consider
				1. Minimize cost as must as possible (don't risk your own money)
				2. Can grow a little slower because we end up cutting corners (by focussing on price over quality)
			2. Know what resources are available
			3. Follow MVP approach
		5. Fake it till you make it
			1. Focus on simulating as much as we can and spend on and resources on products when they are absolutely needed
			2. Present it as if we have already done it (but we have not actually done it)
				1. Selling product even without making it
		6. Focus on efficieny
			1. How much we spend vs how far it gets you
			2. How do we save our bank account
		7. Creativity
			1. We can boostrap in very creative ways
2. How to bootstrap your business
	1. Find co-founders or partners
		1. With own money we may not be able to get to a point where business is running on its own
		2. If we pool money with co-founders or multiple partners we might be able to get to a point where we make money or take investments
		3. They usually have skillsets
			1. The most skillsets you have in your group, the less you have to pay for
				1. If someone knows marketing and promotion, we can save money on the marketing we do
			2. If partner is a developer, we can save money on actual development
	2. Re-work your idea or business model so that it makes money sooner
		1. If we have limited resources, we must be realistic about our situation
			1. We need revenue sooner because we need to revenue to build out the product further
				1. Figure out what part of the product is the most valuable & what part of it we can charge for
					1. Isolate that and build it first (to make money first and use the revenue to re-invest)
		2. Example: Video production company
			1. Make videos, edit, make graphics, actors, pick up locations, ... for people who want to make videos
				1. Bootstrapping it is a lot of money
					1. Then we only buy cameras & focus on editing and graphics
					2. Make money
					3. Expand into the other sections
	3. Do it yourself (DIY)
		1. Very important
			1. Entrepreneur does anything an everything they can during startup phase
				1. In the beginning, we cannot hire people to make everything we need
			2. Focus on what we can do
				1. Build an application and bootstrap it
				2. Learn how to build an application enough to get to a proficiency to get to the first version
			3. I am cheap labour in my company and have infinite time (theoretically)
			4. Do something to get to the point where it is running and working
		2. Benefits
			1. Learning about different aspects of our business
				1. Makes me a better Entrepreneur
				2. We can have a better understanding of what we are doing and why it might work and what's not going to work
				3. Hard to be a successful entrepreneur if we understand only one section of a business
			2. Example:
				1. Amazon: They want every employee to work as a customer service agent for 2 hours
					1. Makes employees understand one side of the business they have no exposure to
						1. Better to come up with product ideas if we know what people complained about
	4. Focus on key metrics
		1. If we are bootstrapping it, we have only so many resources
		2. If we know that we are taking it to the investments, **focus on the things the future investors will look for**
			1. Spend money on things that matter (for higher numbers)
				1. Customers
				2. Margins
				3. How large market is and why we have evidence that it is so big
			2. Smart inverstors care more about the numbers than how polished or how well put together your product or service is
				1. If you say I can make it at $10 and sell it for $200 over and over here, and I spend $0 on marketing.
					1. Probably enough for investment without checking much
		3. Eventually, we run out of cash, and we can switch to other fundraising techniques and we have the numbers to get us there
	5. Focus on gorilla marketing (duct tape marketing)
		1. Marketing that is very cheap and focuses on ROI
			1. We generally do things that are very cheap or cost almost nothing and get buzz (people speak about it)
				1. We do something in a **novel** way and reach out to one person, they will spread it, and the propagation continues
					1. It spreads itself since it is novel
						1. Example: Cheap and funny ads
	6. Sell your equity for actual services
		1. If we are pursuing something that has the potential to make a lot of money down the line (or a modest amount of money),
			1. We can sell a piece of the future
			2. **Equity - invisible money that an Entrepreneur can use to leverage other people to work at the beginning stage**
				1. Take some risk with me and save me this money.
				2. If it doesn't work, you will have an outsized gain in the future
	7. Fill up your credit cards
		1. In the beginning stages
3. Bootstrapping summary - Get as far as you can with as little as you can.
	1. If we go all the way to the revenue - best 
	2. If we don't go all the way, focus on key metrics

### FFF & Angels ###
1. Bootstrapping - smallest source of funding (with personal savings)
2. FFF - Friends, Family, and Fools (anyone dumb enough to invest in you)
	1. Friends, family
		1. Investment is low
		2. Not savvy enough to know if your business idea is good or will succeed
		3. Small loans from friends and family
			1. To get to a point where we get to the next funding source - Angels
		4. Easier to get the money, but comes with strings attached (relationship)
			1. If the business doesn't succeed and wastes their money, it could potentially ruin the relationship (cannot run away from relationships)
3. Angels:
	1. Rich individuals, or high networth individuals who frequently invest in small businesses and startups
	2. They typically help you out
		1. They invest at a stage where we need more capital than what we get from friends and family, but do not qualify for a bank loan, or have a lot of revenue, or any at all
	3. They are often champions of my company & usually well-known in the community
	4. Range: $20k to $200k
		1. More than FFF
		2. Lot less than what we get from VCs
	5. Benefit - We can string them together to make larger amounts of money if we need
	6. Hard to find
	7. Angels typically know each other and have a pretty well-defined affiliations
		1. If we meet one angel, they are likely to know 10-20 other angels
	8. How do angels operate?
		1. They usually have their own investment criteria
			1. So they can vary widely
				1. If one says no, there are others who might fund you
	9. They usually have a lower barrier to receiving investments (vs Loan, VCs)
		1. Reasons:
			1. They are investing their own money (they do it if they feel like doing it)
				1. Usually in small chunks
				2. No approval by fund or board is required
	10. They invest in areas they have expertise in
		1. They are more confident and are likely to invest
			1. Unlike VCs who invest in anything
				1. They usually don't know anything about your industry (not confident so harder to get money from them)
	11. Why do they invest?
		1. They want to make money
			1. They are not concerned about multiples (2x, 10x, ...)
				1. They just think about upside (% increase) and they don't have strict requirements about how big the company could be 
		2. It aids a business they already have
			1. It helps them greeze the agreement
			2. Helps in networking, recruiting in some way that makes their existing business more successful
		3. Excitement and prestige
			1. It is boring to invest in mutual funds, stocks, ETF - doesn't do anything
			2. It is exciting because it could potentially be a big business and also has a likelyhood of failure
			3. Prestige:
				1. They can say they are investors
				2. It's like a badge to show to other people
					1. I invested this much and it has grown so much etc. (if you have heard of them, I am a prestigious investor)
	12. Famous Angel Investors
		1. Chris Sacca - Lowercase capital
			1. Twitter
			2. Uber
	13. Angels invest to make them sound great and bigger than they really are
4. Finding Angels
	1. Connect with successful people in your industry
		1. They don't have to be investors but are successful
		2. Example: Video games
			1. Look for video games similar to what we are trying to build
				1. If there are people who sold their company or someone accessible, try to meet them
					1. **Say you're looking for mentorship**
					2. **Say you're looking for someone to bounce ideas off of**
		3. Approach them from the angel of:
			1. I need mentorship
			2. I need someone to talk with businesses
			3. I need a business deal
			4. ...
		4. Wrong approach
			1. I am looking for money - harder to get them trust you and like your business
	2. Make a list of relevant people in the industry we are going into (even if it is a sub industry)
		1. **LinkedIn - People who list themselves as an "investor"**
			1. Probably invests a lot and is likely to invest in a similar business
	3. **AngelList, Wefunding, Gusto, FundersClub** (Sites)
		1. Invaluable
		2. Social networks for startups and small businesses to find angel investors and VCs
		3. Angels spend a lot of time in them looking for startups that they find interesting
			1. If we spend a lot of time making our page look good and look attractive, it can get a lot of attention from angel investors
	4. Angel groups and sindicates
		1. Angels don't want to spend a lot of time doing due diligence and research on the firm or market so they band together and have one person do the research and everyone makes a decision as a group and invest as a group
		2. They are easier to contact than individual angels
			1. Notable angel groups and sindicates - resources section
				1. If we go through the groups and apply through their traditional channels and websites, it is a great first step
	5. Go after angels who invest frequently
		1. They have a lower barrier for investment
		2. Less frequent investors spend a lot more time thinking about it and are much more risk averse
2. It is a snowball system
	1. We could spend 6 months finding one angel but find 20 angels the next month
		1. Once we figure out something that works, it works really well

### Equity & Debt ###
1. What is equity?
	1. Ownership
	2. Why startups refer to ownerships as equity?
		1. To receive investment
		2. To recruit new people to join their business
		3. Why?
			1. Startups are very ambitious and are shooting for a large outcome
				1. The value of the ownership if it gets big and gets a lot of money, that's enough to get investments and recruit people
	3. Startups measure themselves in terms of stock
		1. Each business owns a certain amount of stock
			1. If you own certain stocks, that's your business share
		2. Stock: It is an easy way to keep track of who owns what
			1. Can refer to different parts of the business
			2. Can refer to different amounts
			3. Different rules are assigned based on different stocks
	4. How much does one own? a few out of the total amount of stocks
	5. Example:
		1. I sold 30% of my equity to an investor
		2. Suppose we make $100 next year
		3. The investor gets $30
	6. Starups
		1. When can you make money out of equity?
			1. If someone buys our shares
			2. If the business gets sold to a larger company
			3. If the business goes public and we can sell it on the public market
	7. Small businesses
		1. $100 profit gives $30 to the investor
2. Dividends
	1. Suppose company has excess profit so they reward the people who invested in a company by sharing some of it
		1. We passed down dividends based on how much they own
	2. The ways to sell equity are called exits
		1. Equity doesn't have value but when you exit, you get the value of it
			1. Exiting
				1. Selling company
				2. Selling shares
				3. Company doing an IPO
					1. Sell it on Wallstreet
		2. When we convert equity into cash, it is called exit
3. Debt
	1. Amount loaned to me that I have to pay back
		1. With equity, we don't have to pay it back but want to share the proportion to the investor when he exits
	2. Paid back based on the terms agreed to
	3. Through APR and APY - Interest percentage
	4. This is more dangerous than equity
		1. If company doesn't do well and doesn't make money, we don't own anything to the investor
	5. Debt needs to be repaid whether the company succeeds or fails
	6. Sources
		1. Small business loan
		2. Friends and family that loaned them money
	7. How to get it?
		1. If we have an established revenue and a decent history of it
		2. If we have physical assets
			1. Buy car, house, etc. for the company and they are mortaged
4. How inverstors work?
	1. Termsheets
5. How do business loans work?

### Loans ###
1. Loans - A form of debt
	1. Loans come from banks and credit unions
	2. Loans range between $10k to $300k
		1. For more it belongs to a different category
	3. Banks gather money from savings and checking account deposits, etc.
	4. Banks make money by investing in businesses
	5. We go to a bank and ask for a loan, and if we meet their requirement, they will approve your loan
		1. They have a criteria list
	6. Pros
		1. Loaned money is some of the cheapest money you can get (business loan)
			1. 6% APR
				1. If business becomes successful, 6% is nothing
			2. It is a decent option (as compared to equity) if company would become very successful
		2. Loans can give you a wide range of money
			1. They give what we ask for
	7. Cons
		1. Loans have a higher bar to quality (than any other investment structure)
			1. We need already existing cash flow OR
				1. We are already making some form of money (doesn't have to be profit but we are taking in money)
					1. Capable to pay back (we have more money to work with)
			2. We need assets
				1. In the worst case scenario, they can sieze those and that's how they can get their money back
			3. They only care about minimizing the risk
				1. They don't care about upside or how much they make in a positive scenario
		2. If you default on your loan, that can affect you personally
			1. Can destroy credit
			2. Can lead to bankruptcy
		3. Banks will not invest in you unless they have 2 years of records of history
			1. Exceptions: Pre-existing relationships might result in dropping to a year
	8. There's a time a place for them
		1. They are good option if we are already there
			1. Otherwise go to other options
	9. Bank loans make sense whe nyou need "expansion capital"
		1. Expansion capital: You need money to grow your business
			1. You may have x amount of orders to fill but you don't have money to fill them and you need the cash
	10. Start a relationship with the bank early on
		1. Establish a history much before starting a business
			1. Much more likely to forgo the criteria for investment
	11. Try small banks and credit unions
		1. Smaller decision structures + few decision makers
	12. Don't try to sell them on the upside
		1. They just care about the risk of losing their investment is low
2. Other Options:
	1. Peer to peer lending - lending trade
	2. More progressive companies - they usually make a decision instantly. They use a different criteria. Less stringent (terms are different so look at them)
		1. Cabbage
		2. Swift capital

### Venture capital ###
1. What's VC?
	1. There are professional institutes and organizations that for a living invest in startups
		1. Large startups & larger companies come into contact with VCs
			1. Sequoia - VC firm
				1. Hold a large portion of Google
				2. Professional firm that staffs
					1. Venture Capitalists
					2. Analysts
					3. Associates
				3. They look for deals
				4. They actively negotiate for startup deals and try to invest in them 
2. When can you go after VC?
	1. When we have a startup or an ambitious idea and we need a lot of money
		1. Lifestyle businesses look for Angel investors long before VCs
	2. Good if shooting for the moon and need millions of dollars to do something
		1. Otherwise think of other options
3. How does VC work?
	1. People don't invest their own money 
	2. They operate a fund of other people's money
	3. They know rich people and take money from them and invest the fund into promising startups
	4. The fund lasts for 7 years
		1. At the end of 7 year period they will return money to limited partner (investor into VC fund)
	5. They are profesionals 
		1. They must make money in 7 years
	6. Access to VC depends on Geography and network
	7. Where to find?
		1. Cities with
			1. Rich people AND
			2. High tier exclusive universities
		2. Why?
			1. Two ingredients for startups
				1. High-tier univs - smart motivated people
				2. Right people - to give money
		3. Larger cities have VC firms
			1. They like to be where the deals are
		4. 90% of the VC money are spent in Silicon Valley
			1. Area between San Jose and San Francisco
	8. It's harder to get attention in a small city
		1. Solution:
			1. Hot to get funded
				1. Get a referral
					1. 400 pitches a week - hard to get attention
						1. Solution: Judge on who they are getting referrals from (if they know it is better)
							1. Don't try to contact them directly
							2. Any referral is better than no referral
				2. Where do you get referrals?
					1. Ask around - If we have friends who have business or owns their own business, ask groups we are part of
						1. Go to your friends who have businesses
							1. If they are successful, they might have come across VCs, and they don't mind referring to them.
					2. Angel inverstors often have connections to larger VCs
						1. A lot of them work in tandem with them
			3. Understand where VC firms operate
				1. VCs are professionals at finding deals
					1. They usually troll through lists like (small businesses looking for funding post their pitches and product videos, and team-member information, and present themselves to public - they get contacted by investors)
						1. Angellist.co
						2. Gusto.com
				2. Go to
					1. Hackathons
					2. Meetups
					3. Events
					4. Pitch & business plan competitions (great way of getting their attention)
				3. Incubators - next lecture (fantastic way)
			4. Make sure you're in the right position to do this
				1. Idea is fully conceptualized
				2. We have real stats and information to support your claims 
				3. Go to them if you actually have revenue and an established business
			5. Odds of having positive interactions and receiving investments come down to how well developed I am
				1. The more we have done, the more attractive we are
				2. Just an idea doesn't attract them
4. VCs are the way to get most money
5. They are biggest risk with regards to receiving investment
	1. They trade money for equity (ownership)
		1. The more money you ask, the % equity might have to be given (40% - 50%)
6. They don't have second thoughts about getting rid of founders or making significant changes to companies after they have bought it
7. 90% of VC funds do not make money
	1. 9/10 investments fail
		1. The one that is succesful must pay for the other 9 that failed
			1. The only invest in companies that have the potential to pay off the other 9
				1. A company that has 90% chance of doubling a VC money is worth less (it pays only two failed investments) than a company that has a 10% chance of going 20x (pays for all 10 investments) on their money
8. How to pitch to VCs
	1. Try to make it larger than it is
	2. Describe the market and describe what we do has a lot of runway, a lot of possibility, and a lot of market behind it

### Incubators ###

			1. However, there's a list of things to be done that are consistent in all of them.
				1. Who owns the company? 
					1. Very important for investors. They need to understand the ownership who are the decision makers. Who's the boss
				2. What do you do?
					1. People usually don't know what I do. They need a quick summary of what it is. It can't be figured out from the website always.

### WORKSHEET: Idea Lister Builder ###
### Section 8 review material ###

## Section 9: Laying the groundwork ##
### The idea equation ###
1. Every business idea consists of different components
	1. If we have only one or two components, we do not have a complete business idea
		1. Example: Ideas that would be acceptable to pitch to someone else, or pitch to investors, or teammate
			1. Complete idea:
				1. People who rent out vacational rentals of their space or people who use services like Phi RBO, AirBnb, they have a problem of buying commonly used items by guests (used at higher frequency like linens & towels, toilet papers, dishwashers). It would be hard for owners to constantly re-buying the stuff, especially when they are renting them out constantly. I am going to make a subscription service that they can sign up for that will automatically replenishes through a mail the items they constantly buy (supplies)
					1. Components:
						1. Vacation rental owners have trouble buying rental supplies, like linens & towels.
						2. This problem would be solved with a subscription service business that automatically replenishes these supplies.
			2. Incomplete idea
				1. Vacation rental owners rely too much on one or two platforms for bookings (finding customers is hard)
					1. Only the problem is stated
	2. Ideas can be broken down into individual components
	3. Ideas evolve over time
		1. Most ideas start as incomplete ideas
			1. We dwell on it 
			2. We add in observations
			3. We notice something else and add it in 
			4. They add more details
			5. Eventually come with a complete idea
2. Breakdown:
	1. Subject - Who in your idea is benefitting from the proposed idea, service, or product
		1. Who?
			1. An individual person
			2. A set of potential customers that share something in common
			3. A business
			4. An industry in general (much broader)
		2. It helps if ideas are as detailed as possible.
			1. It is still helpful to say, this is the group of people I am targeting with this idea
				1. Idea is not complete if we don't know who we are exactly targeting.
					1. Drill down to a specific group of people
						1. Don't keep the target subject as everyone.
							1. Pick a specific group
								1. We can have multiple groups (we don't know for which group the idea is appealing)
	2. Problem/Benefit
		1. A problem or a benefit
			1. What's a problem? (A reductive)
				1. It is something they are struggling with
					1. **They want to do this, but this is preventing them**
					2. **They want to spend more time on this, but they spend too much time on this**
				2. Identify a **pain point**
					1. Pain point: A specific issue that a potential customer has, and we need to address
			2. What is a benefit?
				1. An idea that will benefit that group (ad additive)
				2. **I have found some technology or service or some value I can add, but doesn't essentially cover up a problem, but it is something they would pay to use, something they would enjoy, and it would benefit them in some way**
		2. 90% of business ideas are problem-based
			1. **I personally have this problem, and I personally came up with a solution to solve the problem. Now I am going to apply that to everyone**
			2. Example:
				1. Employees in midsize companies want to communicate with rich media, like images. Currently they cannot, and [it is frustrating that] they have to use x, y, z workaround in order to.
					1. Painpoint: It is frustrating
						1. They cannot share images directly
						2. It is more frustrating if it is essential
		3. Benefits-based ideas are not common but there are good examples of them
			1. Example: By supplying all employees in mid-size companies with bluetooth headsets, they could communicate at 3x their normal rate
				1. A technology that will make them better at what they do, but it may not cover up a problem
					1. We never established that they had a problem communicating
					2. We have also not established that speed was a problem within their communication
			2. Benefit based businesses are harder to identify
	3. Business model
		1. How we specifically address the problem. How we would specifically distribute the value of our services. How we would get our service/product to the customer.
		2. Example:
			1. E-books
				1. Business models:
					1. Ala-Karte purchasing - we see a book, we add it to the cart and we purchase them, they pay you x amount, and they consume it.
					2. Membership - They pay x amount per month for a membership, and consume x amount of books per month.
				2. The above two are exact same businesses with two business models
		3. A business model is testable and can be changed in the future
		4. Tips:
			1. When we have a subject and a problem/benefit, start with the business model that we think is the most appropriate.
			2. Have a couple of business models in mind
				1. If the first one doesn't work out, we can test the others
		5. Apropriateness of a business model to an idea is a big deal
			1. Example: e-book
				1. Inapproriate - Pay what you want model
					1. Offer a good and tell the person to pay whatever they want (it works like a library)

### Areas to isolate & target ###
1. Where do business ideas apply and where can I target my business ideas towards
	1. To analyze a market and come up with potential ideas
2. Subject - doesn't say what section of industry they exist in
3. Business always tries to either:
	1. Make something better OR
	2. Allow someone to do something new
4. Where to apply business ideas towards?
	1. To customer purchasing something OR
	2. To a suppliar or large business
5. How do we know if we are missing any potential customer groups

#### 4 Areas of Innovation ####
1. Procurement
2. Product (or Service)
	1. Product: It has to be obtained somewhere or put together somewhere 
	2. Service: Staffed by someone that was procured from somewhere
3. Delivery
	1. Mechanism used for the product or service
4. Promotion

#### Details ####
1. The four areas we can target, breakdown, innovate, and define a successful business in

#### Product/Service ####
1. Product (or service): Whatever we are selling to an end customer
	1. Example: Individual pizza sold to a customer
	2. Example: Individual tax advice (service) is the product the customer got
2. Each product has several characteristics and traits about it which makes it unique

#### Procurement ####
1. Thinking about where your product or service came from
	1. For physical products:
		1. What went into the product, where did it come from?
		2. How did the company obtain the items that went into the product
2. If we think in terms of service:
	1. Where did the person who deliver the service come from?
	2. How did the business find them?
	3. How did the business vet them?
	4. How did the business train them?
3. Everything leading to the point that they deliver the product to you
4. Procurement: **Everything that happens before the productization of the service/product**
	1. Example:
		1. Pizza
			1. Where did they get their ingredients?
			2. Who delivered them?
	2. How the product was assembled (or how the product is made) doesn't go into the procurement
		1. It is the unique identity of the product
			1. It can be assembled in any way (which is not part of the procurement)
#### Targets ####
1. New Entrepreneurs try to target one of the two
	1. They look at companies and say: 
		1. Example: They sell this, and I can supply it to them cheaper.
		2. Example: I can come up with a business idea that directly targets the way the business procured their product
2. New Entrepreneurs focus way too much on product
	1. They try to make a better product vs what's already existing
3. New Entrepreneurs also look at it as a problem/solution set
	1. This problem is met by this product OR
	2. I can solve the problem in a better way
4. There are two other spaces we can target our innovation towards
	1. **Delivery**
		1. Example: Pizza
			1. The pizza gets to the customer in some way
				1. **The way that the product or value or service is delivered to the customer is a delivery mechanism**
					1. Example: Mail
					2. Example: Put at the front of the store and it is picked up
					3. Example: Phone for tax advice
					4. Example: Skype for tax advice
					5. Example: Online for tax advice - customer bought the service and the meeting was set up online
					6. Example: Mail for packet of tax advice
	2. **Promotion**
		1. It is the advertising channels
			1. It is the way the individual service or product company decided to promote their item
			2. It is a function of what media outlets they decided to put ads on
				1. Internet
				2. Television
				3. Radio
				4. Newspapers
				5. Magazines
			3. It is a fucntion of where they decided to run their targeted campaigns
			4. It is a function of referral programs
5. **Pick which area you want to apply your innovation** (When thinking about industry we want to get into, or problem we want to solve, try to look at it as 4 different quadrants - Pick an area you want to apply innovation towards)
	1. Product/Service
	2. Procurement
	3. Delivery
	4. Promotion
		1. Decide one area and how we can improve it
6. Examples: Pizza
	1. Product/Service
		1. Starting our own Pizza store / making a better pizza
	2. Procurement
		1. Make tooks that target Pizaa businesses
	3. Delivery
		1. Build a drone that delivers Pizza faster
		2. An app that drivers put into their cars for drivers to coordinate
		3. An app for users to see where the pizza is in real-time
	4. Promotion
		1. Design a referral-based system that they put inside pizza boxes that allows them to share it with their friends
7. Tip: **Try to look at every single quadrant for an opportunity**

### 5 types of innovation ###
1. So far:
	1. What goes into making a business idea
	2. What areas in the value-chain that we can apply a business idea or a type of innovation towards
2. 5 types of innovation - for new business or tackling a new market (there are many actually - 30)
	1. Business ideas are trying to improve things or add benefits
3. How can you improve? (market, service, product, ...)
	1. Price - People like lower prices
		1. If we can solve a problem for lower price, we have a business opportunity
		2. How to lower price?
			1. Process innovation: 
				1. We might know a better way of sourcing the material for our product, OR
				2. We might know a way to reduce costs that are incidental
					1. Transportation
					2. Advertising
					3. ...
		3. Another dimension to price
			1. Same product, lower price
				1. There are people who sold the same product, but with higher price
					1. Reason? It increases the perception of quality
					2. Which markets does it happen?
						1. Fashion
						2. Education
					3. When does raising the price work?
						1. When the market obscures what the actual value of the product we are delivering (Education - We pay before getting the education, and there is no refund policy)
						2. Markets where average price charged for the product is low, and people secretly or not secretly are willing to pay more for it
				2. Startups:
					1. They are taking old stale industries and service businesses, they are upping the price, and adding a little bit more to the product offer.
						1. Example: Laundromat - improvement: It is picked up for you, they get hand-cleaned, and folded, and delivered.
				3. Example:
					1. Market or good or product sold is commoditized and quality between the products is indistinguishable.
						1. Example: Fashion
							1. Same set of companies roughly selling the same things
								1. Upper bound and lower bound for the quality of the product is not very big
									1. There is scope for raising the price
										1. Example: School that has higher fee is perceived to be giving a better education
											1. **Higher price increases the percieved value**
												1. Higher price T-Shirts makes you think something is good about the T-Shirts.
			2. Airline industry
				1. They have figured out that the price is the only thing people care about
					1. Cheap airlines with bare minimum service are becoming popular
	2. Convenience
		1. **It is the ease at which a customer can purchase the product or service from you.**
			1. Could apply to effort needed to buy the product or service.
			2. Could apply to difference in time between when they purchase it and when it is delivered. 
		2. Focuses on friction
			1. What is friction?
				1. Every single step or action required by the customer to do something
					1. **If we remove steps, and remove customer actions, we are lowering friction**
						1. Example:
							1. Asking customer, fname, lname, phone, email, ... and sign on the dot
								1. Alternative: fname, lname
			2. Example: Hailing a cab
				1. Walk outside and find a cab
				2. Call a company and say pick me up now
					1. Wait for them, find them, get in the car, they take you wherever
					2. Paid by cash
				3. On-Demand economy - Uber, Lyft, Postmates, Shyp
					1. They add convenience
						1. Take out app
							1. Drop a pin
							2. Press a button
							3. Person picks you up and take you
							4. It is cashless
					2. The model requires fewer steps from end-customer
						1. Convenience innovation
							1. **Look at a product or service, and think to yourself, how could I deliver that with more convenience to the buyer**
								1. **How can I make it easier for the buyer to get and purchase?
							2. Example: Market of Healthcare
								1. To see a doctor, they typically call and make a phone appointment
									1. To make it more convenient: Make a mobile phone application 
										1. Person can search based on the the specialty they are looking for and book online
											1. Example: Zocdoc
	3. Speed
		1. How quickly the value we are delivering can be delivered to the customer
			1. Example: Consider a shipping company. Find a faster way to deliver the package
			2. Example: Amazon focus on making majority of packages eligible for Amazon prime (delivering within 2 days anywhere)
			3. Example: Pizza delivery in 30 minutes
			4. Example: Computer & Software
				1. Something that can compute or run faster, or export faster
	4. Quality
		1. Tricky
			1. It is not just what people consider to be good
				1. Also applies to
					1. How quickly was it delivered
					2. How easy was it to find
					3. ...
		2. It is the individual characteristics people use to judge whether or not something is good, high quality, or bad, low quality, ...
			1. Did the food taste good?
			2. Did the table last a long time?
			3. Is the car pretty aesthetic and sleek looking?
			4. ...
		3. Don't generalize it
		4. Where does quality apply?
			1. Pocurement & Product - obvious
			2. Delivery & Promotion - not so obvious where the opportunities are
				1. These areas typically care about other things
		5. Examples of innovations that people think are quality innovation but they are pitching other types of innovation
			1. Example: Bus that gets you somewhere faster - it is a speed innovation
		6. Quality: Pertaining to product or service, and how it compares to other products or services. We need to figure out how to judge whether it is high quality or low quality
	5. Self Expression
		1. Many innovations or products benefit from self-expressive benefits
			1. As a customer buys a product or service, do they feel better about themselves because of it?
				1. Lower quality, slower, less-convenient products can have better self-expressive benefits
					1. Example: GoPro - miniaturized cameras mounted on head
						1. Lower quality, more expensive, no innovation on delivery, no fast component (slower recording speed)
							1. It has self-expressive benefits
								1. Shows we can afford it
								2. Shows we are adventurous kind of person
					2. Example: Apple
						1. Lower quality, higher price, better self-expressive benefit
							1. People can feel that they are:
								1. Upper-middle class
								2. Active
								3. Young
								4. Potentially cool
		2. What type of markets?
			1. Fashion - more
			2. Electronics - little bit
		3. B2B - Generally don't have self-expressive benefits
			1. Unless it makes employees/management feel better to present it down to their employees
4. Whenever we are coming up with business idea, see if any of the 5 levers can be pulled (any one of them can potentially have a business opportunity. We can also improve in one-demension or multiple-dimensions)
	1. Price
	2. Convenience
	3. Speed
	4. Quality
	5. Self-expression

### Recap of idea dynamics ###
1. Recap
	1. Components of ideas
		1. Incomplete ideas
			1. Recognizing a problem (no logistics. Who would buy or sell it)
			2. Observations - very valuable
				1. Figure out the other parts to complete as a full idea
		2. Complete ideas

					2. What problem is your subject having that you're going to solve with this business?
					3. Alternative: Benefit
						1. Adding value to a non-existing problem
							1. I am going to make this tool/service do X, Y, and Z - The customer didn't crave for X, Y, and Z (value add)
								1. Once they are added, they are more productive, they have more opportunities, and it's a benefit to them

							3. Display
							4. ...
			3. Delivery
				1. How do we get the product to the customer?
					1. Courier service?
					2. Physical?
					3. Ship it?
					4. Download it offline?
					5. Ship slowly through the mail
			4. Marketing
				1. How did you hear about the product to begin with
				2. Add ideas about fixing a problem or adding a benefit in the marketing section of a type of business
		4. 5 Types of innovation
			1. Price
				1. How much are we charging? (Doing one of the below is price innovation)
				2. Can we go lower?
				3. Can we go higher?
					1. To increase the perception of quality
			2. Convenience
				1. How can we get the customer get value from the product in a more convenient way?
					1. Can we isolate the steps the customer has to go through to get to the product and remove them? 
			3. Speed
				1. Example: Can a shipping company ship faster?
				2. Example: Can ride-sharing company get the car to the customer faster?
			4. Quality
				1. Good is not just the product but everything associated with the product.
				2. Think about what goes into the product to increase the quality of it or value of it?
					1. T-Shirts - Think of a material that makes it super comfortable (may be on the chest area)
						1. Quality innovation
			5. Self-expression
				1. Does it feel people good about what they have purchased
					1. Something they can associate lifestyle with - a way of thinking or acting with it
						1. Self-expressive innovation
							1. Example: GoPro
2. Next section:

### Section 9 review material ###
### Quiz 7: Concepts from Section 9 ###

## Section 10: Making it fit ##
### Intro to Section 10 ###
1. You as a component of business ideas
	1. You are unique and you have your own preferences
	2. You cannot come up with an idea detached from yourself, detached from the context of your life, resources you have, your job, and other commitments and expect it to be a fantastic idea that sits on its own.
		1. There is no point in coming up with the best idea in the world when we cannot act on it? 
			1. It is not worth it if it doesn't fit what I want to do, and doesn't fit my goals
2. This section:
	1. Understand your goals, expectations, passions, and hobbies (makes it easier to go forward because we know what to shoot for)
		1. If we know what to shoot for, we are that much closer to coming up with a good business idea

### The Fit quadrant: Hobbies & Passions ###

				1. **Building a business out of hobbies is fantastic**
					1. Hobbies identify what I care about and what I could do for long periods of time

	2. Examples:
		1. Walt Disney - He enjoyed sketching and doodling (cartoon work)

			4. **The ratio of the risk of failure vs the actual likelihood of profit**
				1. Extremely high risk of failure

					2. 5% who succeed: The outcome could be from making minimum amount of money, going on forever and not maing tons of money, bought cheap all the way to being sold for billions of dollars
				2. High potential to make enormous amount of money
		2. Lifestyle businesses - It is a business designed to generate enough money for you to uphold a certain lifestyle. They are obsessed with the ratio of R in ROI (money made to time spent). Business owners first look at their ideal lifestyle, and figuring out the size of business they need to establish to accommodate the lifestyle. (to live in a mantion and make 100s of 1000s per year, then it's a lifestyle business. Read: **The four-hour work week**)

			2. **Sensitivity to competition**
				1. Not sensitive (competition doesn't matter)
				2. Profit goals are also lower
				3. You just want to get people to buy your stuff

#### Lifestyle Business: The four-hour work week ####
1. We can build businesses that require a minimal amount of time investment that can actually return a significant amount of money for us.
	1. You build a business that requires you to work only 4 hours a week
		1. Building a "muse" - Think about all time and we are passionate about
			1. Something we bring in, and there is automatic cash-flow or income
	2. We have a total amount of money in mind - not true for startups
	3. A lifestyle business is only designed to meet your financial needs
		1. If I want to travel the world and want to live the life I want, I need the money to spend on that
			1. Economic duress: We make a decision because of economic needs (we do something because we need money)
				1. Lifestyle business is designed to get away from the economic duress
					1. It takes a lot of time and hours upfront, but are designed to work somewhat on autopilot so that it gives time for you to do whatever you want
						1. Examples:
							1. Drop-shipping
							2. Online teaching
							3. Ebay power sellers
							4. Amazon FBA game
							5. Stock trading
							6. Small hobby businesses
						2. Examples: They can or cannot be lifestyle businesses
							1. Consulting
							2. Service businesses	
								1. Web design firm - it depends on how much money you design for
									1. Depends on how many clients you want to hold
								2. If we want to have a 40 hour week and we want to grow rapidly, it is not a lifestyle business
								3. If we have only 4-5 clients and takes only 4 hours per week, it can be considered as a lifestyle business
	4. If lifestyle business appeals to you:
		1. Focus on businesses that are not particularly sensitive to competition
		2. Look for templates we can use to build a business around
		3. Ensure it is large enough market to make whatever income we want to make (it doesn't have to be huge)
		4. **Set a timeline, reach a goal, then quit**
			1. No one is inspired by their lifestyle business (it is not fulfilling)
		
#### Startup Business ####
1. It's a beast
2. Paul Graham's quote (founder of incubator Y combinator)
	1. **A startup is any business that's designed to grow rapidly**
		1. There's no top limit
		2. No goal to reach
		3. Grow as fast as possible
		4. Grow as big as possible
3. They are big ideas
4. They are ambitious
5. They are things that take a lot of time
6. They have a very high risk of failure
7. There are ideas that often sound crazy but there are ideas that frequently change the world
8. There are buisnesses that take a lot of time to get something out of

#### Side Business ####
1. They are very small
2. They are not designed for or concerned with scaling
3. **We need to look for any basic market opportunity, any service, or product you can reasonably make and just sell**
	1. We don't think about
		1. Changing ecosystem
		2. How we are going to be a big entrant in a big market
	2. We just think
		1. Something we can build that has value
		2. Something we can offload and sell easily in a minimal amount of time
	3. Look for something that you can use your skills and hobbies or we are good at (that could potentially immediately come out of a hobby)
	4. We don't care about scaling and that other people are doing it

### How good does my idea have to be? ###
1. The quality and level of thoughtfulness you need to go into the business idea depends on
	1. Good idea
		1. It is a relative term
			1. It depends on what it is suited for
				1. A lifestyle business would be a terrible startup
				2. A startup would be a terrible side-business
				3. A side-business could be a terrible lifestyle business
2. Example: Udemy
	1. Side-business - Help people design thumbnails for Udemy courses
		1. How good do you have to be to make thumbnails to be successful?
		2. How good of an idea does it really have to be to be successful?
		3. It is just people need, and potentially there is demand for it
			1. No uniqueness
			2. No competition
			3. No profitability
			4. No discovering hidden marketing avenue to scale the business
			5. No uncommon observation
		4. Ensure that the demand is real and it is not oversaturated
			1. If 50 people are doing it - it is okay
			2. If 50,000 people are doing it - it may not be a great idea
	2. Lifestyle business - Being an instructor on the platform
		1. Recognize an unmet need within the marketplace or a topic that does not have enough competition or you don't think is being properly served
			1. Match that to your skills
			2. Build a launch plan around that
			3. Need to build your own unique style, your own pitch, your own tone
			4. Figure out how you can differentiate yourself in a couple ways
		2. It is a little more difficult and not as easy as a side-business
		3. We are still operating within the constraints of the Udemy platform
			1. Try to be good in the given system
		4. Little bit more of observation, information gathering, to decide if it is or not a good idea
	3. Startup - You want to change the world of education by constructing an online education maretplace, because you think there is a growing demand for this type of education. (people are unsatisfied with traditional eduction - hypothesis)
		1. Need to predict that there is much larger market that's festering in the blind-spots of traditional universities - they are too expensive, and they don't teach specific skills.
		2. We also figured out that there are many life skills that do not fit in any real curriculum or traditional education structure
		3. We think that online education has reached inflection point where people can trust online education enough and technology is far enough that you can maintain a minimum standard of production quality
		4. We believe that a number of people will trust online systems, pay for it, and actually have a service or experience delivered back to them that is acceptable quality
		5. It is a lot more complex
			1. We are noticing macro trends
			2. We are taking a lot of information that other people don't know or find controversial
			3. You are merging your understanding of markets, and trends, and sticking them all together and making a bold prediction
		6. **It takes a lot of different predictions, shows that you have an accute understanding of multiple domains, multiple industries, and you can bring all together to make a big bet on the future 
		7. **A good startup may be an observation that very few people have made in the world, about the world, or about people. It could also be based on deep domain knowledge that's made by someone who is an expert or one of the best in their field**
		8. **Startup ideas to be successful, they need to be original**
			1. **They need to have a core unchanging truth that is essential to them**
			2. **They need to plan in making a big impact on their subject**
			3. **They should be comfortable with the idea that they could potentially move a market and become a thought leader in it**
				1. Not all startups meet that level of caliber
					1. The more the startup fits the description, the better chance we have of making a big impact and growing to something big
3. Idea advice
	1. Everyone struggles to come up with those ideas for startups
4. Next:
	1. Eureka meth
	2. **How do people get to the complex assumptions, and complex predictions?**
5. Look at goal sheet 
	1. Look at what you are shooting for ask yourself:
		1. **Do you need a world-changing idea to be happy?**
			1. Not everyone wants to be the next Steve Jobs
6. All ideas are worth considering
	1. None of them are immediately bad
	2. You might have ideas that match all 3 business types
	3. Startup:
		1. Try to pinpoint ideas you have that bring in the most streams of information and bring in the most domain expertise, or things you can pull from your specific experience
		2. Big idea: insert judgement
	4. Lifestyle business
		1. Focus on skills you have and see if you can match that to a reasonable unmet need (a platform, your own system)
			1. Not enormous
	5. Side-business
		1. Look for something that you can do and people will buy

### The Eureka Myth ###
1. The myth: All brilliant people have brilliant ideas and when they have brilliant ideas, they happen with a snap of a finger.
	1. Makes you wait for the perfect idea that just comes to them and they don't need any active learning on their part
2. The ideas that changed the world started as a drastically different idea
	1. The current idea is usually after either a steady evolution of changes or a pivot (take a different direction by sometimes using the same resources, and customers)
		1. Pivot - Very substantial
			1. Founders, CEO, ... is very conciensious of
				1. There's big meeting and made the decision
			2. Drastic, and made at an executive level. Big decisions
3. Evolution of ideas
	1. Happens in every organization
		1. Ideas started differently, and over time, they learned more things
		2. The more they learned, the more they experienced, the idea changed
		3. As the idea changes, it gets, better, and better, and sooner you can't even recognize the original idea
		4. Happens whether or not we embrace it
4. Brilliant people can have dumb ideas
	1. They started as dumb ideas
		1. Example: Facebook - It was an application for one college used to compare attractiveness between classmates
		2. Example: AirBnb - It was started for people to sleep on the floor or air mattress while attending conferences when all hotel rooms were booked.
		3. Example: Groupon - It was started as a website where people could donate to charities.
		4. Example: PayPal - started as application to bean cryptocurrency between palmpilots
		5. Example: Pintarest - started as a tool to mark things we are interested in in a designers website, and email you when they went on sale
		6. Example: Twitter - started as a podcast subscription service
		7. Example: Flickr - started as a video game
			1. The game had photo sharing widget - it was realised to be popular and they pivoted
		8. Example: Instagram - started as a checkin app
		9. Example: Nintendo - started off by selling vacuum cleaners
	2. All ideas are subject to 100s or even 1000s of miniature revelations That've been exposed to new information
	3. **Business ideas thrive on information that is not accessible by the public**
		1. Companies change them as they move forward with them
		2. Ideas never get out of the lab, and never get to a point where they get inside information.
		3. As businesses grow they peek into the market, find out more information, and change
5. **For idea generation, follow what the Lean startup said**
	1. Startups should validate their ideas
		1. Start with all ideas suck
			1. Most of our ideas are actually terrible
	2. Great ideas might sound terrible and terrible ideas might come of positively
	3. Evaluating ideas can be tough
		1. Bessemer Venture Partners
			1. Terrible mistakes they made in venture capital
6. **Every idea comes with [a key set of] business assumptions**
	1. We think they are true, but we will not know unless we test them
		1. We might find that we were wrong
	2. Brilliant people tried their ideas, figured out that they were wrong sooner, pivoted, changed, and eventually got it right

### Section 10 review material ###
### Quiz 8: Making it fit ###

## Section 11: Ways of coming up with ideas ##
### Problem-based business ideas ###
1. Solving [your/someone else's] problems: The most common way
	1. Founder story: Wikipedia
		1. A lot of founders based their business on solving a problem [they have]
	2. This is the most promoted strategy [by media, hollywood, ...]
	3. It is easier to connect with a product or a service. If we have a story that the founder had a problem and couldn't figure out a solution, and the figured out a way to solve it, and they solved it for everybody
		1. Gives some basic affinity for what they are doing
2. How does this work?
	1. You have a problem
		1. Something we have issue with, something we are struggling with
		2. You try to find a solution for it, but cannot find one
		3. Try to build a solution yourself, or try to figure out a workaround, you get especially good or adept at getting around a certain problem.
			1. You solved it
	2. Does the solution apply to other people?
	3. Example:
		1. Dropbox
			1. Sync all files in all computers, tablets, phones, ...

				1. Is it worth the time?
				2. Is it worth putting it out there?

			2. If it isn't broke don't fix it
		3. Problems are often the source of big business ideas
			1. Founders stumbled upon the business
				1. They ended up solving something for themselves, or for their organization, or a friend

				1. Avoids back and forth
	2. **Can I pull it off?**
		1. **Do some research**
			1. How complicated is it?
			2. Are other people doing it?
				1. We are just not aware of the service
	3. If other people have the same problem, do they feel the same way?
		1. Maybe some people enjoy going to doctor's office
			1. **Do research**

### Imagine the future ###
1. Thought experiment: Imagining the future
	1. It is harder
	2. Doesn't always work
	3. If we put enough thought into it, we can come away with something
	4. **It is a technique we can parlay into other techniques**
		1. **We can combine the two and we can come up with ideas**
2. Peter Thiel - Zero to One (Investor - Facebook, PayPal)
	1. Checks how invested they are in constructing the future, or seeing the future they want to build
	2. Thinking in a different way helps coming up with ideas
	3. Question: **What great business in the future isn't built today?**
		1. Open-ended

					1. **What big problems are we going to be tackling in the future?**
					2. **What big companies are going to be there that are doing it?**
			2. How to imagine?
				1. In different dimensions
					1. Your country
					2. Your politics
					3. Technology in general
				2. Think which of those companies that will be doing great things in the future is not being built right now?
					1. Ideas don't sound that great at first
						1. People are skeptical when they try to imagine new innovation
					2. Suppose the idea has grown into a huge business with 1000s of employees, it is well designed, everyone has heard of it, ...
						1. The idea doesn't sound so ridiculous
		3. **Make predictions for the future**
			1. 5 things that we think will happen
				1. **What are those?**
					1. Only electric cars or with hydrogen fuel cells or natural gas?
					2. What sectors can grow in the future?
				2. **Then work backwards**
					1. **If we are thinking of big companies working in the future with future problems, and problems are opportunities that are based on your predictions**
						1. It is plausible that this company does X, Y, and Z. We are missing the boat right now, and we should start working on it now.
				3. **My predictions**
					1. **All repetitive tasks (that have clear defined patterns) will be done by bots**
					2. **Personal gadgets work as personal assistants & care-takers for everything**

					1. Big businesses are built over contrarian position
						1. I disagree with the majority of the population and with this trend, or what's happening in this sector

### Reverse imagination ###
1. We imagine the future, and we imagine what's happening in the future, and then go backwards and think **what in the future is not being seeded right now and it should be being seeded**?
	1. Inverse of previous one
2. Reverse imagination
	1. Example: When we look ads of the past, we think that we did things in an ignorant way (in the hindsight).
		1. What makes you say this was stupid
			1. **I think ________ was ridiculous**
			2. **I think we thought ________ was popular or cool**
			3. **We thought ________ was cutting edge back then**
	2. Imagine you are in the future (10 years, 20 years, 30 years, 50 years, ...)
		1. **If you are in the future, what today you will be looking back at and cringing at?**
			1. What seems really necessary
			2. What seems really dumb
	3. Many entrepreneurs have used the technique to come up with business ideas
		1. PayPal - It was silly that we couldn't transfer money through the internet
	4. **Think of what we use today is unnecessary**
		1. Look in your house and find an item that is ridiculous to use
			1. Example: Physical credit cards
	5. We can imagine a lot of business opportunities that follow the trend. If I am ahead of the curve, I could build something that could be potentially large
3. Search: 35 ridiculous things from the 90s
4. Look at commercials in the 80s, 90s, etc. - to get inspiration
4. **My ideas**
	1. **I think junk food was ridiculous but was popular and cool, witch slowly degraded the health**
	2. **I think people believing hear-say was ridiculous, which led to misunderstandings, conflicts and wars**
	3. **I think people not knowing their health condition until a hell on earth breaks loose was unfortunate**
	4. **I think spending an entire day in a hospital and going back and forth is ridiculous**

### The Fit generator ###
1. Tried and true way to come up with business ideas
	1. To to top 10 hobbies, passions, skills, and experiences
		1. Get rid of the experiences, and passions
		2. **Look at your hobbies and skills**
			1. Put them side-by-side
			2. See if we can construct something of value by matching two of them
				1. Hobbies - things we do for fun, we are interested in working on
				2. Skills - things we are capable of doing, things we are good at doing
			3. **Combining the two heps you come up with ideas**
				1. Making and doing and being good at something that you enjoy doing and other people enjoy doing, you can build a rudimentary framework for business ideas
					1. **Action** is in skills
					2. **Passion** or motivation to tacke the problem in hobbies
					3. **Customer demand** or customer interest in the hobby (everyone else probably havs a similar hobby)
		3. Example:
			1. Hobby: Baking, Skill: Web-Development
				1. **Blog** - It could advertises recipes, and we can sell advertising space on that small business
				2. **eCommerce** - Other people could list recipes or baked goods, and other people could buy it
				3. **Mobile App**/ Web application - That helps bakers save recipes, put timers, swipe through a list of recipes as they go through and tells them when to move on to the next one. They could also share how well the item came of. If it came of well, they could share it with friends.
		4. We have to stick a business model on top of the idea
			1. Next - Business Models - New ones that are disruptive
				1. Can also be used for old stale industries
		5. Finally have combinations of all the three
			1. List them all out
			2. **Pick the one you like the most**
		6. Business models examples:
			1. Web Development + Bakery + On-demand
				1. On-demand mobile app 
					1. To deliver freshly cooked baked goods
			2. Web Development + Bakery + Shared Economy
				1. App for selling leftover baked goods (extras)
					1. Couier system that everybodywho bakes 100 things, they want to sell 20 to cover the cost of 100. The courier service picks them and sells to people who want to eat them.
			3. Web Development + Bakery + Subscription
				1. Customized recipes website - pay $10 / month
					1. Every week we get customized recipes with video tutorials that are very specific and very helpful - not public content
		7. Pick a skill and a hobby, and add a business model (multiple of them)
			1. See which ones make sense
				1. We can make some business out of the three
					1. It is only that whether it makes immediate sense to me or not
2. Why does it work?
	1. If we have more skills in our business, we are more likely to succeed
	2. If we have hobbies related to business, we are more likely to be passionate about it, and we are more likely to be motivated by it
		1. If we are motivated to fix problems, motivated to spend the correct amount of time to figure out whether or not it's worth it, and do long hours
	3. **Pick skill & hobby. See if we can make a story between the two see if we can make something that's value adding**
		1. It doesn't have to be something that people will buy right now, but it must be value adding
	4. **Stack on a business model on top**
	5. **Read those out loud and have a couple that might be interesting**
	6. **Evaluate it** (next)
		1. If we don't like it after evaluating it, rinse and repeat
			1. **Go back to the list, pick another combination and evaluate**

### Cater to power users ###
1. Strategy for small businesses, mid-size businesses, potentially large businesses (only in an indirect way)
	1. Catering to power users
		1. Power users - Users that use the platform or service that is atypical of normal users (the ones who use the most get the most out of it)
			1. Platforms - Marketplaces, subscription services, ... (anywhere where lots of people interact with it) (it is a big company)
				1. When businesses construct marketplace startups, or platform-based startups, they have the obligation to cater all of their features and all of their services to the entirety of their user base
					1. When ebay, or Amazon constructs admin tools, and services that help buyers and sellers facilitate trade, they will focus on X, Y, and Z that every single user has demand for
						1. X, Y, and Z features appeal to person who buys 1 thing every year or 10 things a day
						2. X, Y, and Z features appeal to seller who sells 1 thing or 5000 things a day
			2. **Power users** - use the platform or service to the extreme
				1. Generally top 10% of the user base
					1. Varies from platform to platform
						1. Top 5% users may be buying or selling 60% of the items
							1. Based on power law:
								1. Power law: A small group of people disproportionately produce a large amount of the goods or services in any system
									1. Deep well - Go for deep but thin well
										1. Go for small group of people who really really want your stuff vs a large group of people who are not totally sure
									2. Applying power law is a perfect way of starting a deep thin well strategy to grow your business
				2. Examples:
					1. ebay - Auction website
						1. Power sellers probably sell more (10 or 100 times more) than a regular seller (1 or 10 things a month or year)
							1. Power sellers have legitimate operations going on
								1. They have need for legitimate large services to help them with large shipping, operational, and financial needs
									1. Consignment store - it is a small business opened up to work with power users just to help them list their excess inventory 
										1. List, maintain, answering questions, figuring out who bought it, packaging, selling it, ... is a lot of work when doing 100s or 1000s of items
											1. Small businesses with small margins cannot justify having a team to run it
										2. Power users drop off their items there and they take a cut and sell it
										3. They also work with regular users because they take a large portion of the money
						2. **What are the needs of the poser users?**
							1. That ebay doesn't have or isn't supplying them because they can't justify it based on their entire user base?
								1. Many
						3. Power users don't want to write descriptions and make a list and make it look good
							1. Ebay has a templating system
								1. Simple
								2. Takes time to edit than to construct a new one
						4. Ebay doesn't have flash-sales
					2. Amazon
						1. Lots of power users of ebay are also in Amazon
						2. Some users sell millions of items, but some sell a couple
							1. 1000s of items - becomes hard to do basic tasks. Hard to use generic services that are not customized
								1. Customer service - Item is returned, it must be fixed or refunded in a certain amount of time - potential opportunity
						3. **Gold rush phenomenon**
							1. People are all rushing onto the platform to write Kindle books
								1. People are writing books, (ghostwritten), and selling them
					3. Udemy
						1. Power user business - many opportunities
							1. Analytics
								1. Who's looking at my page
								2. How many bought my course or not
								3. ...
							2. Split testing
								1. How do we know if we have witten good description vs bad description?
							3. Course thumbnails designed
							4. Course promotion packages
								1. YouTube strategy
								2. Facebook strategy
								3. Immediate feedback
								4. Early reviews
							5. Design
							6. Bumpers
								1. Sprint kick in the beginning and end (demand)
							7. How to reach them?
								1. Get on to facebook group and message
				2. See what the power users need that they're not getting and cater to them
					1. Works on newer platforms
						1. Udemy - 2 years behind
					2. Find a community
						1. Anywhere people are spending money, they're invested in getting exposure or sing a platform
							1. Examples: Etsy, Airbnb, Getaround, ...
						2. Zephyr - for Lyft and Uber
							1. Helps Uber drivers understand when people are most likely going to be landing at the airport and gives suggestions on when to stake out at the airport to get rides
				3. Pick a platform, and research it
					1. See what the problems are
					2. See what people are complaining about
					3. Get some familiarity to understand it
					4. You will find plenty of problems with wide opportunities to start making money
					5. How to promote?
						1. Hijack their platform
							1. Use their platform to communicate with them or get their attention

### Reposition Good/Fast/Cheap ###
1. It is the easiest one to do, and there are many opportunities
	1. Great to get some ideas flowing. Great for market opportunities as well
2. Good/Fast/Cheap - Marketing theory
	1. Applies more to service businesses (providing a service instead of selling a product) & less to product businesses (can still be used)
		1. Theory: Every business can be rated on three different dimensions: Good, fast, and cheap
			1. Good & Fast: Firms that are really quality focussed & focussed on quick turnaround
				1. They don't have cheap prices
			2. Fast & Cheap: Low price and quick turnaround
				1. Quality is not their focus
			3. Good & Cheap
	2. We can find businesses that are bad at all three and okay in two and bad at the third
	3. **Any service business can only be 2 out of 3**
		1. Good + Cheap - For quality, we need to be flexible on time
		2. Cheap + Fast - Give up on quality
		3. Good + Fast - Give up on prices
			1. People who will deliver it will be expensive
3. Take my-fit worksheet
	1. Choose a skill or passion (hobby, passion, experience, or skill)
		1. Focus on each item
			1. Try to think of a business in any of the spaces we like what they are doing and we think they are on to something
				1. We could think of a company that we love what they are doing but we thing it could be done better
					1. **Improve their service by using a different combination of the 3 criteria** (good, fast, and cheap)
	2. Example: Creative writing & help people with research essays
		1. Figure out the two elements they are going for
			1. Example: Good, fast - but expensive
				1. Other options:
					1. Fast & cheap - good for students that are procrastinators (turn around quickly & they want it cheap)
					2. Good & Cheap - To focus on big essays that are not time sensitive but cant really compromise on quality (dessertation)
	3. Example: Instacart - ondemand company. Private shoppers who pick the groceries for you and deliver them to you for a fee (convenience)
		1. On-demand - fast
			1. They are not cheap
			2. Good: They get their orders wrong frequently
				1. They cannot make decisions that we couldn't make while shopping ourselves
		2. They are: Pimary fast, average good, but not very cheap
		3. Other combinations:
			1. Fast (on-demand) & Cheap
				1. Focus on a model or logistics system that work with lower cost laborers
				2. Focus on working with the closest crocery store
				3. Focus on working on our own grocery store where everything is pre-packaged and easy to pick up
		4. **Another approach: Instead of tackling their entire system, we can tackle the problem they are going after**
			1. People don't want to grocery store, they think it is a hassle, and they are busy, and they are ready to pay a little bit more to get what they want
		5. Good + cheap (not fast) - opposite of what Instacart does (not on demand)
			1. Ship it (slow)
				1. I can buy all the things in bulk
					1. Target stuff that everybody buys and constantly needs to recycle
						1. Example: Staples
				2. I can buy in bulk and ship them from one place (it's cheap)
				3. I can work with brands and ship you brands (it's good)
4. **Take other two combinations and see which one matches the market better or fixes the problem better**
	1. Example: Boxed
		1. Good + Cheap (as opposed to Good + fast done by Instacart)

### Section 11 review material ###
### Quiz 9: Ways of coming up with ideas ###

## Section 12: Business models ##
### Saas: Software as a Service ###
1. SaaS businesses
	1. Business model
	2. Whether it can be used for our business idea
	3. Benefits, pros, and cons
2. Most popular business model
3. SaaS - it is just a business model
	1. It is just how you charge for the value you are delivering
		1. Any business delivers value
			1. If it delivers value, we can pick a number of business models
				1. Starting a SaaS business doesn't mean anything because it doesn't say anything about what we are building and the value we are delivering
	2. SAAS - Software as a Service (not Software as a product)
		1. SAAP - People buy it for X price and use it (OS - Windows) (you may pay for security updates separately)
			1. Example: Video games - 1 price
		2. Technology has advanced - We can do a lot more in the server and the browser.
			1. Storage and bandwidth are becoming very cheap
				1. People cn use things like Amazon EC2 - extremely cheap way of hosting applications
		3. We can make a browser version of a desktop application
			1. Charge them per month, per week, or per year basis automatically renewing
			2. We store all the information
			3. We do all the processing for them
		4. Most popular tools we use online and pay monthly are all SaaS tools
		5. We don't have to hire someone for every section of our business
			1. We can use a SaaS tool
				1. Virtual assistant: Zirtual.com
				2. Payrol: ZenPayroll: pay per month
				3. Taxes: Turbotax
				4. Project Management: Trello, Asana, Basecamp
		6. SaaS is usually a cloud-based system
			1. Processing, storage, and everything going on, the value creation process for software is not going on on the computer but happening in data centers
		7. The dynamics of a SaaS tool
			1. Put software on the browser and make it available on any device or computer - great strategy
				1. We can reach a lot more people
				2. We can grow our business more easily
					1. More people signing up
					2. More people paying me
					3. Purchase more data centers and more bandwidth
			2. For physical products
				1. We need to ramp-up manufacturing
				2. We need to ramp-up marketing team & sales team
			3. For Saas
				1. All done in the cloud, and done automatically (we don't have to scale our effort)
				2. SaaS businesses spend 20% - 40% on marketing and sales
					1. Advantage
						1. Most companies can be lower than that because they have higher overheads
							1. SaaS frees up a lot of resources to spend on other places
						2. We can advertise online
							1. We can use prior established traction channels, and its relatively simple. Below are well established
								1. **Banner ads**
								2. **Pay-per-click**
								3. **Pay for actions**
								4. **Affiliates**
				3. Example: SaaS tools
					1. Xero.com: Bookkeeping and accounting process online
						1. Gives analytics
							1. Reduces cost of in-house bookkeeper
					2. Spotify
						1. Music service
							1. We are not downloading
							2. We can stream music
							3. Subscription: $10 per month
	2. SAAS tools:
		1. Browser based OR
		2. Downloadable but charged over and over
3. **Things that really work well for SaaS tools**:
	1. **offline to online**
		1. **Service that immitates what people usually do in real life on papar, physically in person, and we are putting it online** - perfect
			1. It is not convenient if they downloaded software and paid for it once
	2. **Services that are used frequently**
		1. **Because, most SaaS tools charge monthly, yearly basis etc.**
			1. If they don't use it frequently, they will not renew
				1. Then one-of payments is better
					1. Much harder to scale your business
	3. **Collecting user information**
		1. Is it convenient to store that information?
			1. Evernote - we can store all information
				1. If it disappeared, we have lost all the information
	4. **Selling a software** - browser/desktop
		1. Good for locking customers into a re-occurring payment to use it
			1. Helps us grow our potential market (VC Trick)
				1. Example: Balsamiq
					1. Desktop - Paid once
					2. Online - They store info and recurring payment per month
	5. **Avoiding copies and piracy**
		1. Photoshop - Shifted to creative suite, Photoshop CC, ...
4. **When SaaS tools don't work**
	1. Software tool that requires a lot of RAM or requires specific info from the client that you would have to get in person someway
		1. Example: Video games requires a lot of compute power and harder to play on the browser
		2. For physical products, think of a hybrid
			1. Example: Freshbooks - Invoicing tool online (SaaS)
				1. They also have print and ship options
				2. They charge per month but individual increments everytime we print and mail 
	2. If we can do everything online, SaaS tool is best
	3. Startup & Lifestyle businesses
		1. Hard to do with side businesses
			1. SaaS needs a minimum level of maintenance

### Subscriptions & Memberships ###
1. Susbscription: A service that charges you monthly
	1. Typically gives you unlimited access to their services or their goods
		1. It could be called subscription or membership
			1. Depends on what benefits we are getting from purchasing a membership
				1. Membership: Access to purchasing something else (it is first paywall, then a second paywall)
	2. With subscription, we give a per month cost and the customer can take whatever he wants within a timeframe
	3. Example: Creative license companies, stock photo companies, Envato market (high resolution photgraphy)
		1. They don't charge per item, but per month and e can consume a certain amount
	4. Tier system
		1. Monthly, quarterly, yearly, ...
		2. Limited content unless we pay for higher tier
		3. Example: Skillshare
			1. Pay per month, we get to watch whatever we want
				1. They think consumer will stick with them longer
					1. Companies usually try other models and they have found that they have lower retention rates
2. **When does it work?**
	1. When we are selling something that has negligible incremental cost
		1. Incremental cost: How much does it cost a supplier, or provider of a service for every new item or new service that your customer consumes
			1. Example: Repair shop with subscription model
				1. They might pay subscription and can overuse the service
					1. We lose money every time they use it (subscription model incentivises people to use it as much as possible)
	2. Good examples:
		1. Digital good: Anytime they download something, it doesn't cost me much. We don't worry about how much they consume
	3. If customers and consumers don't get much value if they buy only one thing
		1. Example: Skillshare
			1. The courses are significantly shorter than a Udemy course
				1. $20 for 45min course - customer may not be thrilled with it
					1. $10 / month for any number of 45min courses a month is a good deal
	4. If we have planned to offer a large amount of content
		1. Not good if we do only one thing
	5. If we are selling something and we lose money on the sale of a product or sale of a service
		1. Example: Zipcar - rent out and charge per hour basis
			1. $100/year to be on their service and have an option to rent a car
				1. They have to do background check on me, add me to insurance policy that cost them more
					1. If I just sign up and not use any car, they have just lost money 
				2. It's a membership to use their service (it's usually a flat fee to get access to their goods or services)
	5. Consumable business ideas - to make a habit out of a product
		1. Example: Food
			1. Coffee
				1. People will buy frequently and they build a habit of purchasing our product
				2. Blue-model coffee - x amount of coffee per week or per month
		2. Revenue comes from people who forget to cancel (unethical)
	6. Your product needs to be used frequently as a pre-requisite
		1. Example: Dollar shave-club sells razors
			1. Deoderant stick lasts long so not good for subscription
3. With membership model, is a **price innovation** play
	1. Example: Constco (wholesale) - retailer that sells food, furniture, mattersses, home goods, etc.
		1. Bulk - Lowest prices we can purchase anywhere
		2. They charge per year
			1. You can shop there and purchase the stuff
		3. They make $0 profit for the goods they sell, but make 100% of the money from the memberships themselves
			1. They give very low prices so that no one can compete
4. When to use Subscriptions & Memberships
	1. If we are doing something that is software-based
	2. If we are doing something that sells multiple products
	3. If we are selling something online digitally and doesn't cost you to give a service or give a product
5. **See if we can use it as a key differentiator and see if it unlocks a unique setup that customers might find appealing**

### PWYW: Pay what you want ###
1. Controvertial
2. Companies are experiencing with
3. Premise
	1. You let customers decide how much they pay for it
		1. It is like a donation box
			1. They can pay what they think it's worth
			2. They pay double because they like the fact that you offered them the option
			3. They may not pay anything
4. Certain parameters that will make it work and certain parameters you want to stay away from
	1. When to use this model?
		1. Whatever we are trying to sell has zero overhead
			1. Very very minimal, and negligible overhead
				1. Everytime people buy another one, it costs me nothing
		2. Average price is lower but it makes up for in volume because more people purchase
		3. If low overhead, you don't mind what people pay but you just want people to pay
	2. When not to use this model?
		1. A time when I wouldn't do this would be say, when your target market doesn't have a lot of disposable income
			1. They might take advantage of it and not pay anything
				1. It is better to sell them to upper middle-class to middle-class
5. Example:
	1. Luis C.K.
		1. Comedy show tickets - recording online
			1. It doesn't matter how many times it is downloaded. It didn't cost him anything
		2. Shows that
			1. He is unique
			2. Increases distribution
	2. Stacksocial
		1. Sell online courses and do them in bundle
			1. They focus on marketing section of innovation - they focus on selling them
				1. When people buy it, it doesn't cost them anything
	3. Lyft
		1. Started with donation model
			1. Suggested donation: Donate extra or nothing - they were trying to avoid taxation
	4. Udemy
		1. Pay what you want and take these courses
			1. Offer at something to get something - because otherwise students will wait for free coupons anyway
	5. Priceline
		1. Name your own price model
			1. I only pay $100 - They just put you anyway possible as long as you get to the destination (can have many layovers)
			2. Price for hotel - as long as it is in a general area, they will give it to you
		2. They put constraints
			1. It's not pay what you want model
				1. It is a reverse auction
					1. If you want to pay $100, if a hotel pitched that price, then you would get the hotel
						1. There is a minimum floor price - There will not be anyone who would accept it
6. It works only when you have a low overhead or you are selling inventory that otherwise would go unused completely
7. Use it with price controls and be smart about it
8. **Good strategy if we are just starting of, if you want to get a marketing bump or a PR bump**
	1. It gets you a lot of attention
9. **A lot of companies can use this model, not because it is the best way of making money, but because they make a lot of money off getting your email address and selling you things later**
	1. It's okay to pay a dollar and get your email address
	2. They will make it up later my marketing to you

### The sharing economy ###
1. Very new
2. Sharing economy:
	1. A company or a business idea that plans to allow individual people to monetize assets they aren't used to selling
	2. They are all marketplace startups
		3. They are connecting people in ways that are non-traditional
			1. Traditional marketing: match buyers and sellers, and trade ownership
			2. Sharing economy: We can do it in-person and we are sharing it, renting it, or loaning it
				1. Example: Uber, Lyft (ride sharing) - we can drive our own car and pick up people riding in the city
					1. They are turning you and your car into a monetizable asset (we are an unlicensed cab)
				2. Example: Airbnb - to rent out our space in our apartment to people who are traveling through town (we can undercut hotels, charge less, and get paid for extra space)
					1. B&B with what we already own without putting extra time
				3. Example: Getaround, RelayRides
					1. They allow us to rent out a car we own to people on a per/hour basis
				4. Udemy:
					1. They match people who have ideas or expertise and match them to people who want to use them
				5. Vayable:
					1. They work in big cities
					2. They let people come up with walking tour guides and they run their own group tours
			3. **They leverage individual creativity and entrepreneurship of indivdual people and allow them to make money as a side-business or as a contractor**
	3. Name: It is a system or a company that allows you to make money of something you otherwise would have shared
		1. We share things with friends
		2. If we share it with strangers, we could potentially charge for that privilege
		3. In some situations, it is a big win
			1. When people travel to a city, they can stay at someone else's place with a price significantly lower than a hotel's price.
			2. If people want to make money of of a living room they are not using much, they can make a significant amount of money
	4. **Think of something that you underutilize and could monetize by sharing it**
		1. We can share it for a small amount of money
		2. We can share it with a wider network for a little bit of money
		3. Examples:
			1. Class notes
			2. Textbooks
	5. Business ideas work well based on generational lines
		1. Technology is making it easier to have shared economy businesses (smart phones, ...) 
		2. Millenials (20s) are more trusting of one another
		3. Older generations are less trust worthy
			1. This business model doesn't work for older demographics
	6. You have a supply and demand issue
		1. If we are trying to make a system or marketplace where you share an item that everybody has, you have to pick a market/type of asset that is owned by medium amount of people (If too many people hold an asset, then no one is going to need it. If too few people own the asset, then price for sharing it will be too high, and they will negotiate the reason why they are sharing it in the first place)
			1. Example: Sharing toothbrushes doesn't make sense - cheap to buy them, everyone has them, no-one needs them
			2. Example: Sharing welding equipment - very few people have it. The price of sharing it will be pretty mutch close to the cost of getting someone professionally weld for you 
	7. Pitfalls
		1. Sharing budinesses go around the rules (already established regulation)
			1. It could be illegal in many cases
				1. Example: Haystack - Selling parking spaces to people who needed it
					1. App is used
	8. We are helping people share something and it's an asset not used to sharing
	9. How to come up with ideas?
		1. Imagine Government doesn't exist
		2. See what you can do without laws
		3. See how you can make it work with laws
#### My ideas ####
1. **What can be shared (not used by me very much)?**
	1. Room
	2. Car
	3. Byke
	4. Tools
		1. Big ones but portable
			1. Drill machine
			2. Vacuum cleaners
			3. Laptop (extra)
			4. Shoes
	5. TV
	6. Online subscriptions
	7. Farm tools
		1. Tractors
		2. Attachments
	8. Extra cooked food
	9. Excess vegetables and fruits
	10. Baby items
		1. Cribs
		2. Swings
		3. Battery vehicles
		4. Bikes
		5. Play-area toys (not very portable)
		6. Baby seats
	11. Printer
	12. Books

### Marketplaces ###
1. Marketplace business model
	1. Any business that relies on connecting buyers and sellers
		1. They don't actually build the services they are selling
			1. They get really good at filling the needs of both the buyer and the seller, and playing a match-making role
				1. Many opportunities
				2. Very popular
	2. In microcausm
	3. In forums
		1. A separate sub-threads are created as a buy and sell exchange - simple way of setting up a marketplace business
			1. Examples: eBay, Etsy, Udemy
				1. eBay: Allows anyone to sell anything in an auctioned format
					1. Other services offered:
						1. They help buyers find customers and customers find items
						2. They help you make your item look better, price it effectively
						3. They also give buyer protection insurance
				2. Udemy:
					1. Software + bandwidth + customer service
				3. Etsy: Small crafts
	4. What do they do?
		1. **Faciliate the exchange** - so that people can buy and sell with ease
			1. Convenience innovation - They are trying to make it easier for both sides
	5. Amazon: They are rerouting it to a different company (not buying directly from Amazon)
		1. Matched seller with buyer
			1. **It is only a match making service and not an actual service business**
				1. **Notice something that people want to buy, but you don't want to make it yourself**
					1. Potential marketplace play
						1. Look for an unmet demand and who can offer it (comparable community)
							1. Why aren't they already connected?
								1. People who sell want to focus on hat they do best - run their service, or build their product
									1. But they are not good at marketing themselves or finding people to sell to
									2. Big expense to take on
										1. If they don't know where to find potential buyers
											1. If I make something for $7 and sell it for $10, I have only $2 for spending on finding potential customers
								2. Significant overhead costs
									1. Examples:
										1. Getaround - match people who can rent out cars with people who want to rent cars.
											1. Where to find people to rent it from?
											2. How would you pay for overhead costs like unsurance?
												1. They have on blanket insurance policy - they buy insurance for 1000s of cars
												2. They have economies of scale and saves them a lot of money
											3. How would you find a system to handle logistics?
												1. With mobile application
													1. They have tracking system
													2. Customer support network
													3. Any damages to the car are handled
2. Marketplace business opportunities
	1. If we know people that want to make side-money
	2. If there are people who want to sell some service but struggle with two things
		1. Finding people to buy it themselves, or not worth it for them to do it
		2. Significant overhead costs that don't want personally to cover
	3. If there is an existing company, by making a marketplace that offers the same product or solves a similar problem we can actually lower the price
		1. Example: Getaround
			1. Zipcar - owns and maintains all of the cars
			2. Getaround - found people who wanted to rent out cars. The prices are significantly lower
3. Downsides:
	1. The marketplace conundrum - We are building a two sided community and each side will not join without the other (chicken-and-egg)
		1. They can't get any buyers to come on because they don't have any sellers yet
		2. They can't get any sellers to come on because they don't have any buyers yet
			1. It takes significant amount of money and time to tackle it
		3. They are little bit larger and take longer to run
		4. Questions to ask:
			1. Would the buyers come to the market if the sellers were not there?
			2. Would the sellers come to the market if the buyers are not there?
			3. How many buyers need to be there for sellers to come?
			4. Do you have a situation where one of the participants in the marketplace is much harder to get and much more valuable?
			5. Is it possible that you manually fake seed one side?
				1. Build some items ourselves to populate it with something - it gives some traction
					1. It gives little bit to offer to the buyers so they come and that starts the cycle
				2. If both buyers and sellers have the same importance, that's much harder
					1. It is easier to run a marketplace when one side is important and the other side is not
					2. **We can entice one side to join the platform because they have nothing to lose or they're in a weaker position and then we can use it as a bargaining chip for the more important side**

### On Demand ###
1. On-Demand Company
	1. Any company that takes an ordinary service or ordinary business and tries to improve it by adding an extreme level of convenience and speed
		1. Done using smart-phone technology
		2. Done by targeting people with more disposable income
		3. Done with fancy branding
	2. Examples:
		1. Uber
		2. Lyft
		3. ...
		4. Washio
	3. Example services:
		1. On-demand massages
	4. Look at basic service that happens all the time and thinking I can make it a lot faster and a lot more convenient
		1. End-customer will pay a premium or extra for that convenience 
	5. Everything is done from your phone - typically a mobile-only strategy
		1. There are some web-components
	6. Convenience innovation
		1. We can hail someone to
			1. Clean your apartment
			2. Wash your clothes
			3. ...
		2. As opposed to traditional business model where we need to call, book an appointment ahead
		3. It removes intermediary steps
	7. Speed innovation
		1. When you do order one of the services, they typically get it done within a shorter timeframe than what's usual
2. Consideration
	1. **Do the people need this product/service right now?**
	2. **If yes, would they pay extra for it?**
		1. Sometimes people want the service now but don't want to pay extra for it
	3. **To make it work we have to cater to the people with extra disposable income**
		1. Doesn't work for people who do not want to pay the extra convenience fee
			1. Not profitable
	4. **We can usually take any business and make it on-demand**
		1. How long will it work for?
			1. Successful businesses also make other innovations (not just on-demand)
				1. Uber:
					1. Don't have to use cash
					2. People can become a taxi and make money in between jobs or when not working in their other job
					3. They have significantly lowered the price
						1. Opposite of on-demand plays
3. On-Demand businesses ideas
	1. Think of what you hate acquiring (something that you acquire regularly)
		1. It is worth trying with something not found
		2. Add it with a local modifier strategy

### Curated Boxes ###
1. Newer business model
2. Curated Box
	1. When a company starts to sell a lot of small things into a monthly box, and they curate what goes into the box each month
		1. Usually sold in a subscription model but it is different
			1. They choose what you buy
	2. Works if we are curating a lot of different goods and selling them to a very specific type of consumer
	3. You yourself don't produce anything
		1. We are essentially a shopper but shopping for 10s of 1000s of people
		2. You can take advantage of millions of sellers and retailers out there (boutique sellers)
			1. We can find almost endless combination of items, put together and sell them as a package
	4. They work in bulk
		1. They say we have 10k customers and we need to fill ther box this month with four goods
		2. They can go to each supplier and negoiate a lower price for each item
		3. In some situations they get subsidised or get paid to include other people's items
			1. Since we include new things each month, it can be used as an advertisement
				1. Sample items can be liked and bigger version can be purchased from the actual company
	5. Examples:
		1. Burchbox
			1. They sell samples for things women would like (fragrances, or makeup)
			2. **They found that women like sampling perfumes and makeup, but they purchase one or two, and put a lot of thought into it**
				1. We can get samples delivered to your home and we can do it at home for a small amount of money
					1. They can later on buy the full price item - it is quite expensive
		2. Nature box
			1. Healthy snacks
		3. Bar box
			1. Toys for dogs
		4. Bespoke post
			1. Lifestyle items - for lumberjacks, or hipster
		5. Beef jerky, dipping sauces, ...
	6. Examples of non-physical items
		1. Curate high quality photography 
			1. Sending by mail
3. How to come up with ideas:
	1. Consider whether you are not an expert in some space
	2. Whether or not you want to sell something that has lifestyle or self-experssive benefit to it
4. Is this the right model for you?
	1. **If we can find one group of people and what they like, and if we can find unlimited products to serve that need, we have an opportunity to use this model**
5. Go for products that have a high replacement rate
	1. Foods are the best
		1. If people eat snacks and they might want more of the snacks, so they wait for the next snack to come
	2. Bad example:
		1. Dog toy box - we don't need toys every month
			1. They just pile-up
	3. Shoot for things that get replaced quite often & try to stay away from things that can meet the need almost immediately

### DTC: Direct to Consumer ###
1. DTC business model
	1. Not new
		1. More popular now due to internet & shipping innovation
	2. Only to physical products
		1. Skip any sections to sell the product and go direct to the consumer
			1. Example: Don't send a dishwasher to retail outlet but send it directly to consumer
		2. Advantages:
			1. Ship it only once from company to consumer (not re-routing)
				1. Lower per-unit cost
			2. Skipping retailers - we Don't have to cooperate with a retailer
				1. Saves cost
				2. Retailers take a lot of time managing them
				3. Retailers take up a lot of your profit (20% to 80%)
		3. We can do price innovation play due to cost savings
			1. Example: Dell computers
				1. DTC only usually
					1. Much more competitive price (significantly cheaper)
			2. Example: Luxury goods
				1. Designer clothing - ship it directly to consumers at a massive discount
		4. Problems:
			1. We have a branding issue 
				1. Selling high-end items at a discounted price is not obvious win
					1. People might assume it is lower quality - they may not understand immediately why it is so much cheaper
		5. Exciting now because:
			1. With the internet, we can sell almost anything
			2. Shipping is getting cheaper and cheaper - global gas prices are quite low
				1. Helps us lower the price considerably
2. How to use it?
	1. What are you trying to sell (physical product)
	2. Do you need retailer to sell it?
3. Advantages:
	1. Website - overhead for running a website is very low
		1. Helps us spend money on other things like marketing and lowering the price
4. Getting it right is tricky
	1. The item size has to be proportional with the price
		1. Why? 
			1. Large items cost a lot of money to ship
				1. We could spend more on shipping than what it would cost of the item
					1. Shipping an encyclopedia can be enormous
	2. **Ship small things that are more expensive**
		1. Shipping cost is negligible and we can make plenty of money on the actual product
5. Examples:
	1. Warby Parker
		1. They have trendy glasses that have subscriptions built into them
		2. They have built an entire model skipping optometrist and skipping eyeglass stores
		3. Virtualization online
			1. Try on the glasses
			2. Purchase through them
		4. Shipping is cheap
			1. They ship three times for free
				1. Third time, they make a lot of money (the glasses are expensive)
6. Pitfalls
	1. Low-price items are loss leaders
		1. They lose money but somehow by establishing customer contact, the company makes money later
			1. A curated box model is better for low-price items
				1. Plan for demand and inventory are not required
				2. Make a box
				3. Know how much to buy
				4. Get it in bulk pricing
				5. Ship it all at once

### Crowdsourced catelogs & inventory ###
1. Newer business model
	1. Tricky to conceptualize
	2. Tricky to use
2. Crowdsourcing inventory
	1. A twist on e-commerce
		1. E-commerce - They sell a variety of different things
			1. How do they choose what goes into their product catelog?
		2. How does it work?
			1. Example: Teespring or Gusto (Jeans company)
				1. They allow other people (individual people) to determine what their inventory is
				2. Based on the demand from the buyer side, they pick what's the most popular, what's going to sell the best
		3. Letting people decide what they want to buy
		4. Example: Gusto
			1. They come up with denim jean ideas. They will say they are going to use this material, they are going to take user submitted suggestions and then they see if enough people are interested in it and will buy into it, if they do they will do small batch production and ship it to everyone
		5. Example: TeeSpring
			1. Manufacture only if certain amount of pledged shirts or pledged dollar amounts is reached
				1. Only produce T-Shirts that are profitable
3. Benefits
	1. Building a community - around what we are doing
		1. We get people energised about how you sell and then what your model is
	2. We also limit risk when it comes to selling an item that won't work or wasting a lot of time marketing and conceptualizing what people want to buy
4. Problems
	1. It backfires if you want to protect your brand
		1. Crowd can pick things that are contrary to how the company want to brand or present themselves
5. **Works if people are incentivised in some way if they produce content for us**
	1. Example: Teespring - you get paid for what sells
6. It can work but we are working with two active communities
	1. People who want to buy what you are selling
	2. People who wnat to make what you are selling
7. It works with people who are aficianados within the space
	1. Good lifestyle businesses
	2. Startups - depends on the market
	3. Side-businesses - Not
		1. We need to build and run the platform and needs promotion (decent investment)

### Section 12 review material ###
### Quiz 10: Business models ###

## Section 13: Evaluate & test ##
### Intro to Section 13 ###
1. We're going to evaluate your ideas
2. We usually come up with a lot of ideas
	1. We will not immediately know which ones are worth pursuing nd worth putting off to later
3. This section:
	1. We will set priorities
	2. We will set basic criteria to drill down on each idea to see which one has the most potential and is worth putting our time into first
4. Evaluation:
	1. We are only looking at the idea (not validation)
	2. We are not doing outside reasearch
	3. We are only making subjective judgements on quality of it based on certain dimensions
5. Validation:
	1. We took the idea, built the product, built the website, did MVP and tried to sell it

### Matching Fit ###
1. Take pieces of the quadrant and see if your idea fits them
	1. Hobbies & Experience - ideas based on both
	2. Experience - idea based on it
		1. If we have experience in one industry, that could play of in another industry and give a leg up on different ones
	3. Skills - Look at an idea, and see if you could use any of your skills in the process
		1. Web developer - web app
	4. Passions - Larger and broader
		1. Check if at any point of your business, you will be touching passion points
2. If you have lots of things that match the criteria, it is a good indication, and if you have nothing or only a few, it is a bad indication
3. **Questions to ask yourself**:
	1. **Could I do this every single day without losing interest?** (10 hours every day, 7 days a week)
		1. If have to work an extra month without burning out, can you handle it?
			1. It is easier if it has something to do with your hobby or passion, but a little bit harder with only experience
		2. **Experience and skills matter more than passion**
			1. If we are only matching skills or experience, we can still be motivated and get a lot of value and enjoyment out of our business
				1. Why? We are good at it
	2. **If this idea failed, will I still gain valuable lessons and learn valuable skills?**
		1. Yes - positive indication 
			1. If we can come out with something, it is a lot easier to stay motivated at it and waking up everyday knowing we are going to work towards it
		2. No - Riskier proposition
			1. A little bit harder to get motivated
	3. **Do I have a step-by-step plan for my idea?**
		1. Do you have some general idea of how you are going to go about validating it, building it if it is a product, and finding customers?
		2. If we think of an idea and we don't know where to even start, it is a bad thing
			1. It means we do not have enough experience and it's actually going to be a detriment to you
				1. You are going to spend way too long picking up basic stuff that you would've known if you had a little bit more experience
				2. You need to atleast have a vague idea of
					1. Who I should talk to first
					2. Where I should do research
					3. Whose opinion I should follow
				3. Think critically
4. Re-evaluate your enthusiasm
5. Ability
	1. Different from skills
		1. It is your ability to execute on this idea
			1. Could be specific ideas to this business
			2. Could be more generic
6. A business opportunity that you can't pursue is not an opportunity
	1. A wide open market trend that you need billions of dollars and a huge team to tackle but it would be lucrative is not a business opportunity for you
		1. It is for large companies, billionaires, or who just sold their last startup
			1. Example: Apple tree
				1. What apples are available to you is a function of how tall are you
					1. Whether you have resources to get to the apples (like ladder)
					2. Whether we are ready to sit 24/7 for apples to fall
						1. We don't have time resource to sit all day
			2. Does your idea have a window?
				1. Some ideas have expiration dates (not a bad thing)
					1. It's going to be an opportunity for a short period of time or a definite period of time
						1. Entering a business and make money only for next two years
							1. Do we have the ability to get in and out within the window?
								1. If you have lower abilities, don't focus on ideas that have definite windows or if skeptical about how long the opportunity will be available
7. Do you have the ability?
	1. **Try to evaluate your ability objectively**
		1. If you have no startup or business experience
			1. **Break it down into smaller pieces**
				1. Take the idea, break it down, and look at individual pieces
					1. See if you can do every single piece
						1. Example: Web application
							1. Conceptualize
							2. Prototype
							3. Build
							4. Sell
							5. Manage employees
							6. Make business development contacts
						2. Check how many you can do on your own
				2. Once you identify what you can and cannot do, and you have passion to pursue it:
					1. **Pick one piece and build a business around it**
						1. Example: Managing Airbnb properties
							1. Breakup
								1. Sales & Marketing
								2. Optimizing people's listing descriptions
								3. Managing cleanings
								4. Managing checkins
								5. Managing expectations with guest
								6. Relaying communication between host and guest
								7. Setting up system where you can respond to enquiries
								8. Try to make sales and bookings
								9. ...
							2. If you don't have experience with some of the pieces, pick one that you have experience with and build a business around it
								1. Cleaning or Airbnbs 
								2. Helping people optimize their listings
								3. Become a host
							3. Make money with one piece, enter into the market
							4. Get familiarity and start building your name in that space
						2. Big businesses started of small going after a niche market and trying to dominate it
							1. Once they succeeded, they went into larger market - that's how you know them now 
						3. Start off with small markets, then expand as you get more experience
						4. **Leverage your experience, contact, and your newfound ability to work in this space to expand horizontally**
8. If you feel strongly about your idea after going through the evaluation, then go ahead, but otherwise, note that you don't feel great about how it fits you as a person

### Sustainability ###
1. Sustainability: Longevity of your business
	1. Once the business grows and scales, is it still sustainable?
		1. Lifestyle/side-business don't need longevity
			1. **How long do you want to spend on this business?**
			2. **Check if your idea matches that**
	2. Startup: Look for as much longevity as possible
	3. Who knows how long market is going to last?
		1. We can get a decent sense
2. Questions to ask yourself:
	1. **What's going to happen to your market when you become successful?**
		1. Once you are successful, you are going to change the dynamics of how players are going to work in your market, you change potentially the pricing dynamics, you potentially knock people out of the market and give opportunities for other people to come into the market
			1. How is it going to change?
				1. We could say, it doesn't change much
		2. Example: Fixed
			1. Mobile app that scans parking ticket and contest in the city for price. If they win, they get 50% of it, if they lose, you pay nothing.
				1. They hire one person to go to courts all day with a bunch of tickets
					1. Cities lost revenue and they banned the app. They also blocked the company from accessing parking tickets
		3. Example: Haystack
			1. To auction off public parking spaces
				1. It became politically unpopular with cities
					1. **They didn't realize how will different players react**
		4. **You may end up crushing yourself under your own success**
	2. **Are you dependent on another platform?**
		1. Are you building it on top of another platform or are very dependent on another platform?
			1. Example: Udemy
				1. What happens if the platform disappears?
				2. What happens if ebay, etsy, ... disappear?
		2. What if there is a dot com crash and a lot of businesses go out of money and outta business?
		3. Example: BranchOut - LinkedIn on Facebook
			1. Facebook made a change to their platform and BranchOut crashed
				1. Facebook had certain rules and BranchOut was using those rules to get users, but Facebook changed the rules and closed the window, and BranchOut went out of business
	3. **How will your competitors react to you coming into the market?**
		1. You usually come up with a product slightly better than other competing product. The competitor looks at your product, and since they have much larger resources, much larger market, so they do it and they always win the market because they have more customers. more resources, and they nullified any advantage you had
		2. Example: Pebble watch - e-reader
			1. Apple, Motorola, ... came out with similar watches, so pebble is not interesting anymore
		3. Example: Apple is becoming a problem for streaming services like spotify
			1. Apple has overwhelming dominance of the market and they have a large reach and they have already negotiated licensing price with the music players which makes it really hard to compete with them
		4. If you think large companies will react negatively, ask the following question:
			1. **Do you have something specific that others can't imitate?**
				1. A startup is nimble, fast, flexible, and there are a lot of things we can do vs large companies (VCs call them aircraft carriers because they cannot turn quickly) who cannot respond very quickly or really at all.
		5. We might enter a market in which doing something would be unpopular if larger company did it
			1. Example: Uber
				1. They don't buy cars, but they are Transport Network Carrier 
			2. Example: Breeze
				1. Buys cars or makes deals with lease companies to get people to use their cars and drive on Uber
				2. **They are operating in a way that they know Uber will never do it**
					1. Because Uber doesn't want to own cars (violates TNC - may lead to fines, fees, ... legal battle)
3. Sniff the ideas and evaluate based on the above criteria
	1. Make note if they go through or remove the idea if they don't
	2. Lifestyle & Small business: Sinsitivity to competition is lower
		1. Larger player doing something doesn't really matter

### Path to validation ###
1. What is path to validation?
	1. How well do you visualize the path you'd have to take to get to validation?
		1. How easy or simple is it going to be?
		2. Validation: It is getting our business or idea to the point where we have essentially established that there is for a fact demand for your product
			1. It is not just establishing that vaguely people wanna buy your category of product - it is usually very specific
				1. We know for a fact that specific product will sell to your customers
					1. **How well can you visualize that?**
						1. They are not steps to success, steps to growth, or steps to profit
							1. **They are steps to validation**
2. What is required to validate your idea? (To understand this is where I need to get to, and this is where I need to stop, and assess whether it is easy to get to that point)
	1. The difficulty of the validation process
		1. Some ideas are easier to get to validation and some are not
			1. They are functions of markets they are going into, or business models they are trying to work with
			2. It has got to do with your idea itself
				1. Example: Making proteing bars
					1. Easy to validate
						1. Protein bars for people on diets (atkins, southbeach, Paleo, zone diet ...)
							1. Lot of packaging
							2. Lot of preservatives
							3. Lot of sugar
								1. It conflicts with people who are on a diet
						2. How would you validate that people will buy it?
							1. Specifically the customer group that will buy the product from you (not generically)
								1. Estabish: **We are going after a certain diet, and people in that diet recognize that they want your product and pay you in some way**
									1. How? A landing page
										1. It could have a photo of what it would possibly look like
										2. People buy products online even without seeing the product
										3. No need for
											1. Research
											2. Build
											3. Production batch
											4. Fancy website
										4. The result is the validation
				2. Example: Hard to validate. Credit card technology that solve lots of problems
					1. Maybe make a system that's (potential problems it solves or offers certain benefits)
						1. More secure
						2. Faster
						3. Saves people money
					2. Needs a lot of leg-work
						1. Prove that
							1. Customers use the product
							2. Customers are okay with using the product
							3. Merchants agree to accomodate the new system
							4. Online processors like Visa, Mastercard, American Express to agree to process through your new card type
						2. Problem?
							1. They are all interconnected
								1. People who use the card are not going to buy the system if they can't use it at their favorite stores.
								2. Their favorite store is not going to buy a system to accommodate the card if no one's using it.
								3. Credit card companies are not going to use it unless they have a very strong reason to switch a large part of their system to your new technology
						3. To figure out it is going to work, we have to validate three different sections that are co-dependent, and could probably take a very large budget, or a very strong reputation behind you in order to be taken seriously by all three parties
						4. **How do we decide at what point in time they are validated?**
							1. **Proving your core assumptions**
								1. Prove whether our core assumptions were right or wrong
									1. Core assumptions: **When I have a business idea, I think it will be successfull because of this reason**
										1. **What assumptions have I made that have to be true for this product to be successful?**
											1. Example: Protein bars assumptions
												1. People on diets have problems with protein bars and they have some sort of a need around that
												2. People are willing to buy something online that they have never seen in person
												3. Whether we can make a protein bar that fits the diet is not validation because that doesn't have anything to do with whether the idea is going to sell.
													1. It is only figuring out that we are not capable of pulling it of
											2. Example: Credit cards assumptions
												1. People are having trouble with their credit cards
												2. All parties have issues with the current system that's set up
												3. People care about things like upgraded security
													1. Assumption that they have problem with the security they have now
												4. People are willing to try a new technology
													1. Usually not the case
														1. A lot of industries are resistent to new technologies and new change
															1. They usually follow other people
										2. **Get to a point where we can answer all the questions**
											1. If we say yes to all the core assumptions, we have validated the idea
											2. If we say yes to only some of the core ideas, we have probably not validated the idea and we might need to change it
3. If an idea has a long path of assumptions, it doesn't mean it is bad
	1. **It only means that feasibly, you are going to take more risk pursuing it**
	2. If you have two ideas with easy path to validation, and one with hard path, it would have probably taken the same time validating the easy two ideas as the hard one
4. **Think about how soon can you validate your idea?**
	1. Product: Typically easy
	2. Something farfetched: Depends on individual circumstance
5. Summary:
	1. Think about the idea
	2. Think about how we framed validation
	3. Some ideas are very hard to validate, and some are pretty simple
	4. When do we need to validate?
		1. Identify core assumptions
			1. **What am I exactly assuming to be true for my business to be successful**
