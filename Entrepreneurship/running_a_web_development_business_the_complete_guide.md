### Seven reasons to start a web development business ###
1. Why?
	1. It's very rewarding work
		1. Seeing something from a napkin to something we can see, interact with, and play with, and see other's do the same is very redeaming
		2. We get to stay up to date with all sorts of breaking things in the web and in the mobile development world (old, new, ...)
		3. If you love tech, it is a very engaging and fun way to make money
	2. The bulk of money is in development
		1. Conception, and lauch - typically handled in-house by a client
		2. Design and development - outsourced or contracted frequently
			1. Bulk of money
			2. Development is more expensive than design typically
				1. Design ~ $500 and development ~ $10,000
					1. Design:
						1. Branding
						2. Logo
						3. Launch icon
			3. Real opportunity to make a lot of money and scale
	3. Margins in web development are amazing (25% to 70%)
		1. If developing on our own, we can get a fantastic wage to ourselves
		2. We can double ourselves
			1. If we start making $50/hour, we can take larger projects
			2. Then someone can work next to me or next to that person (I have multiplied myself)
				1. We can get a lot more done, and we can get a lot more money
	4. You set yourself up for startup success in the future
		1. If we have an awesome system and an awesome product, and an idea, then point the idea to the awesome system and it gets done
		2. Regular founders take months to find the right people, and they could potentially take years to figure out who fits in the organization and who doesn't. What's everybody good at? What are we capable of building?
			1. With development businesses, we get it on day one whenever we want to start our own thing
	5. You get exposure to a variety of online disciplines
		1. Disciplines that are very had and takes years and years to get experience with
			1. Project management
			2. Client management
			3. Sales management
			4. Managing accounts
			5. How to hire and fire
			6. How to vet people
			7. How to recruit people
			8. How to figure out who's good and who's not
			9. Basic skills, product management, UX
		2. The skills are very in-demand
			1. If this doesn't work, we can pick up a job in any of the skills
		3. Get your own sales
		4. How to prospect clients
		5. How to get good clients and how to keep them
		6. Account management
		7. Wide-variety of exposure to different technologies
		8. You will talk like a developer and communicate with a development team
		9. You know what works and what doesn't
	6. You can set it and forget it
		1. Web and mobile development are a great opportunity as a passive income source
			1. Get couple good clients
			2. Make sure you have the process down to continue to work with them and retain them
			3. With Agile methodology, we can check on projects every two weeks (when you get paid)
			4. 4 clients? 4 meetings every other Friday
	7. You can add development as an extra service you offer
		1. If you can say I can do development also for you - it is the bulk of the money
		2. Clients stick with you because you take care of all their needs
		3. We can also contract out development and build a good team

### How to add development services to an already existing business ###
1. Ways
	1. List it on your website (freelance website, say)
		1. Add a separate tab or afternote (don't spend too much space for it)
			1. It is a subcontract - add separate section (but an added perk)
	2. Add it to your branding
		1. Change taglines
		2. Add to logo
		3. Add reference to hearders or business cards
		4. Example: Digital agency (SEO + development + ...)
	3. Attach development estimates to all projects
		1. As appendage or side-thought
		2. If you are interested, we can also develop it
		3. Samething works for bills
			1. Estimates are helpful for clients - we are just giving information as to how much it might cost, and how long is it going to take
				1. The more prices the customers have, the better position they're in to make a good decision - estimate saves them time

### Review sheets & resources - all in one PDF ###

## Section 2: The Essentials ##
### Understanding the development stack ###
1. Basics
	1. To be successful
2. -

### How to pick a stack ###
1. The sandwitch of technologies that go into the website or mobile app we are making
2. Some people have preferences
3. Tips:
	1. Work with what you're used to (language, technology)
		1. Niche techologies requires specialist
		2. Same websites can be built using any language and tech-stack
		3. Stick with the one we know or are good with
	2. The languages do not matter
		1. Differences are marginal
		2. Focus on the people
			1. The ones with the best results
			2. The ones who we can communicate with
		3. Go with which person is the best and the technology they are good with
			1. **People don't care about technology but they want good, cheap and on time**

### The startup timeline ###
1. Expectations
	1. A lot of work upfront
2. Timeline
	1. Think about strategy
		1. what is your angle?
		2. What are you oing to try to sell?
		3. Are you going to be picking a niche?
		4. Are you going to be a generalist?
		5. Are you going to pick a specific technology?
		6. What are you going to go after?
		7. What do you think your value proposition is going to be?
		8. How to pick whether to be a niche operator or a general operator?
	2. Decide what you want to do
		1. Types:
			1. Mobile only studio?
			2. Web only studio?
			3. Wordpress/Drupal studio?
			4. Front-end only?
		2. Do some research
			1. Assess your skills and interests
				1. Go in the areas where we have prior experience or skills
				2. If not, go into areas we have inclination towards, or deep connection with a specific business vertical, or a specific business community
			2. Assess the opportunities
		3. We will not make much progress in the beginning
			1. It depends on me and how quickly I can make decisions
				1. Some people know exactly how they want to do it and they know what angle they are going to go for, they know how to present themselves, and they are going to do it tomorrow.
				2. Some of us need prodding and poking to figure out what makes sense and what actually works
	3. Establish a web presence
		1. Somehow
			1. Make a website myself
			2. Set up a facebook page
		2. Make sure people are able to find you
			1. A very basic identity - a way for people to contact you
	4. Focus on how to capture clients and piece together a good team (simultaneously)
		1. You can do both at the same time
		2. Getting the word out and finding people who are willing to pay you takes trial and error
		3. The "trough of sorrow"
			1. Time when you don't know where you can find big clients from and where you can find consistent business from. At this time, you feel you are not doing anything right
		4. People will always need development services
			1. There is always an opportunity to do it better, cheaper, and people who can be replaced because you have a better relationship
		5. It's a process and processes take time
			1. **Reach out to the instructor and the discussion group**
	5. You will figure it out
		1. After experimentation, we would figure out who are the good designers, who are the good developers, who's consistent, who's reliable, who are the people you want to work with full-time or even hire full time
		2. We will know what we are good at and what we are not, where we are competitive and where we are not
		3. You will find your niche
		4. There are many ways to construct a development business
			1. It's easier if you have a prior established network (or domain expertise in something)
				1. Example: Innate knowledge of Real-Estate and networking with people of Real-Estate agent will help you
		5. It takes time + effort
	6. The next step: Growing (or becoming master of clients we already have)
		1. In the end, you stop advertising and start charging more
			1. We might get saturated with a niche that people are willing to pay you a premium to work with you

### How does this work as a programmer / non programmer? ###
1. Programmer
	1. Focus on subcontracting
		1. Think about your participation
		2. We can take much larger projects on
	2. How are you going to get the projects made?
		1. Lead developer OR
		2. Part-time developer
			1. Other time is spent on looking for projects or managing projects we already have
2. Don't program
	1. Use it to transition out of being a developer
		1. Into a project manager & client manager
	2. You have the advantage of understanding
		1. Technology at a granular level
		2. If something goes bad, you understand the project well enough that you coach the contractor or coach the person you hired into fixing it or what direction to go
	3. Look for good subcontractors
		1. Give them test projects and test accounts and see how they perform (trial and error)
			1. Add the person as expertise and offer to the otherside
3. Both
	1. First, build it yourself and then hand it over to other team members
	2. Take on the next big project
	3. At the beginning you have to be:
		1. **Project manager**
			1. Coordinate with the contractors who are building your application that you are being paid to build
		2. **Client manager**
			1. Manage their expectations
			2. Give them updates
			3. Talk to them regularly

### How do development firms typically work? ###
1. Types of development companies (two buckets)
	1. Full-stack
		1. Client-side & Server-side
		2. Typically building from scratch
	2. Specialized
		1. They usually pick one layer and specialize in that
			1. FE - Only JS, HTML, CSS, ..., images, ...
		2. Setting up servers
		3. Specific technology
			1. Node.js
2. Another categorization
	1. Custom
		1. They build all of it
			1. Architect
			2. Write all the code (don't use code from anywhere else)
		2. These firms always emphasize using custom 
	2. Platform
		1. They use components built elsewhere
		2. They build on top of something (wordpress, drupal)
			1. Firms specialize in those platforms and customize those platforms to fit people's needs
		3. These firms always emphasize using platforms

### Build yourself or subcontract? ###
1. For programmers
2. We know what we are capable of
3. Don't program 100% of the time
	1. We cannot do a web-dev business if we do it a 100% of the time
		1. Who's bringing the projects?
			1. After you finish the first project, what next?
			2. Contracts - they are bursts of work
				1. We do it once
				2. Some maintenance
				3. Some add-ons (slower frequency)
	2. You also have to do marketing and sales
		1. How much?
			1. Do you feel comfortable being a lead developer if you are spending only 70% or 50% of your time on the project?
	3. Why programmers have an advantage
		1. Experience and expertise allows to have critical insights and make much better project decisions during a project
		2. You may not be the one bringing programming skills to the table
			1. **The best role of a programmer-founder is oversight**
				1. **You're much more useful to your project when you're inserting your little bits of brilliance directly to a contractor or through management and basic management oversight**
	4. Manage the project
		1. You are a combination that can use **low-cost contractors + High quality product**
			1. **For premium quality product, work with higher paid contractors, and then convert them into a really high, high quality of product**
		2. Focus on low-cost options (since you are technical)
	5. Think about how you use your time
		1. You're in the best position to help the project
			1. If you are the person doing programming every single day, you don't benefit from collaboration (we don't enjoy the synergy of bringing someone to collaborate with you)
		2. You need to take time off of programming & focusing on oversight & focusing on delivering value through that management

### In-house hiring or out-of-house? ###
1. Most dev studios have employees (in-house staff)
	1. At first, it was not worth employing due to no consistent project work (we need to transition into it)
	2. Disadvantages of bringing someone on as an employee
		1. It's harder to take on a variety of projects
			1. With contractors, we have flexibility on who you let go and who you hire - for wider variety of projects
			2. We are stuck with the skillset they have
				1. We can look for a contractor who has skills and/or experience with the technology that the client wants the project to be done in.
			3. An employee continues to get paid even if he does or does not work on a project
		2. It takes time and a lot of paperwork
			1. Hoops to go through
			2. Takes a long time to ramp up on your team
			3. If you have a big project, you may not be able to service that with actual traditional employees
			4. If a project is doing well and clients are doing well, it might take time to ramp up to meet their new demand
		3. Recruiting is difficult and expensive
			1. It is really hard to entice people to work for you
				1. There's so much competition
				2. You might end up paying a premium
		4. It's difficult to fire them
			1. Cost of replacement might also be high
		5. Housing is expensive
			1. Per employee, office space is $40,000 per year
			2. It's overhead
		6. Off-hours are expensive
			1. In-between time when developers are working on a project and when they are not
				1. If they have only an hour left, but they don't have anything for the hour, it is lost time
				2. If there are no projects, they sit around a week to two weeks
	3. Advantages of In-house
		1. Your project quality and your ability to meet deadlines will increase
			1. Close feedback loop with employees
			2. They can work overtime when needed
			3. They are concerned about making a good product and make their clients happy
		2. Communication is better
			1. Ability to collaborate
			2. To come up with solutions to problems
			3. To come up with new project ideas
		3. They don't cut corners, they are more involved
			1. They don't have any incentives to do so
			2. Contractors care about billable hours, and about one section they are assigned more than finished products
		4. Employees step up if they need to.
			1. Contractors are not very likely to step up
2. Big companies usually care more about quality
	1. They primarily work with people who don't even think about budget
	2. Contracting is good if value proposition is different
		1. It's easier
	3. Product quality doesn't require employees
		1. If every product needs utmost quality
		2. Contractors are more flexible with creation of combinations
3. What do you want?
	1. Flexibility vs. Ability
	2. Full-time vs Part-time
	3. Cash vs Reputation
4. **Cash + Part-Time (ratio of work put into vs how much we get out of it): Contractors**
5. **Full-time + Reputation (to build something really big, high publicity): Employees**
6. Find the perfect fit for you (must align with your goals)

### Section 2 Review Material ###

## Section 3: Planning your strategy ##
### Good - Fast - Cheap ###
1. Business tip
	1. Golden rule for development firms
		1. Understand **value proposition**
			1. Value proposition: What exactly can you deliver to the customer?
				1. Taxi - cheaper and faster than if you walked or you owned your own car
				2. Simplest way of summing up what exactly you are offering in your service
					1. What are you offering with the combination of skills and product?
						1. **Three main things you can be**
							1. **Good**
								1. It means we need to spend a lot of time on it - not **Fast**
								2. Need to work with people of higher exprience - not **Cheap**
							2. **Cheap**
								1. Saves money by having loose timelines - Not **fast** - using off-hours or lean-time
								2. If we lower the quality of the output - Not **Good**
							3. **Fast**
								1. **You can only pick two**
									1. Suppose you deliver websites or mobile apps quickly (fast)
										1. We are cutting corners somewhere
											1. Not spending enough time - not **Good**
											2. Working with people who are extraordinarily efficient - not **cheap** (need to pay them more)
					2. **Good + cheap** - loose timelines (we cannot keep certain projects and promises)
						1. For companies that have aspirational projects
						2. For companies that have projects not dependent on other sections of the company
						3. **Focus on keeping the costs down, and keeping the quality high**
					3. **Focus on optimizing 2 of the 3**
						1. If we cannot be good, focus on how **fast + cheap** you are.
							1. **Maintenance projects**
							2. **People who do not need premium quality products**
								1. They need something that's going to function and something that's not terrible
					4. **Good + Fast**
						1. Need to hire the best people
						2. Find companies for who bundget is not a concern
							1. They just want top quality
							2. They want it fast
	2. Keep this in mind while building strategy

### Planning for the grind ###
1. The grind: Time when we are not bringing any business or a lot of business
	1. You are trying different things that simply do not work
		1. Every business goes through this
			1. If you are starting from scratch, you need to figure out what works and what does not work
				1. Applies to what you build
				2. Applies to what clientale you're good with
				3. Applies to what are good ways of finding new clients
		2. **Prepare to fail**
			1. You fail more often than you succeed
				1. Every business has this problem
					1. **Find things that work**
					2. **Take the things that work, and do them a lot more (scale them)**
	2. Focus on fundamentals
		1. Focus on fundamental metrics that make you a good business & that make you appealing to new clients, and clients that are thinking about bringing back work to you
	3. What strategies work depends on your niche, what you are trying to build, and who you're trying to go after
		1. **Find the best combination**
			1. Finding the best way to find clients
			2. Finding the best way to find the best clients
			3. Finding out how to do it repeatedly until you have a very solid stream of business coming in
		2. **Prepare for this period**
			1. Know that it's coming and know that it's going to happen
		3. **Do things that do not scale**
			1. For early startups and development businesses as well
				1. Scale - grow (exponentially)
					1. Spending goes from $100 to $1000 on sales
					2. **Anytime we take an effort and do more of it**
			2. Example: Scaling a Facebook ad - Just change number from 100 to a 1000
				1. There's no incremental amount of work required to advertise more
				2. As opposed to physical signs - 2 signs requires twice the effort as compared to one sign
					1. It is not possible to build 10k signs by 1 person (it doesn't scale)
						1. We cannot do it repeatedly forever
			3. What does it mean?
				1. Think about strategies (to find client, sub-contractors, to improve the quality of your application) - 2-5 strategies
					1. **Try to do them as cheaply as possible and manually**
						1. Advantages:
							1. Allows us to monitor costs
							2. Allows us to not spend any money in the case that it doesn't work out
						2. Example: Facebook ad
							1. You design the campaign, you run it, you monitor it, as opposed to hiring someone to do it for you
								1. **Don't hire someone to do it for you** - unnecessary money and energy - likelihood of it working out is pretty small
									1. It takes many tries before you find something that works
										1. **You do it on your own to figure out what works**
										2. **Test it first, scale it after**
			4. Concierge service
				1. A lot of applications when they start off, they are trying to validate whether their idea is popular and whether or not people will pay for it
					1. They first simulate what the application is doing
					2. The founders are doing the work on the backend themselves manually
						1. It doesn't scale but saves enormous amount of time, effort, and money to figure out whether their technique is good and their product is going to be popular
		4. **Don't scale until you absolutely know that it is going to work**
		5. **Be patient**
			1. Try multiple techniques before something works really well for you
				1. Get traction channels and use them to get more clients
		6. Say yes to any business opportunity in the beginning
			1. Helps us understand whether or not we are going to offer it in the future
			2. Later on you say no

### To niche or not to niche ###
1. Nice company or generalized company
	1. Picking a niche
		1. One of the effective ways to get clients - picking a niche and focusing all effort on that space
			1. Example: Vertical niches
				1. Medical
				2. Government
				3. Real-Estate
			2. Example: Horizontal niches (Freelance firms, say)
				1. A specific technology
				2. A specific platform
				3. A specific framework
				4. Security - Works with companies that need specialized security
					1. Security for banks only
2. Should we pick a niche?
	1. Do you have a strong network/affiliation somewhere?
		1. Example: If you were a real-estate agent, you can go after real-estate companies
			1. We can naturally talk to those clients, and understand what they expect
		2. If you don't have a group of people you don't have affiliation to?
			1. It becomes hard to pick a niche. We don't have a personal connection to.
				1. In this case, **you can just pick a niche arbitrarily**
					1. Something that we think is competitive
					2. Something we think will give a good margin
					3. Something we think we can access easily in terms of marketing and advertising
			2. A connection to the group will make it a lot easier
	2. What are you passionate about?
		1. A technology or group
		2. Example:
			1. Passionate about web-security - try to build something around web-security
			2. Passionate about bitcoin - build something around bitcoin
		3. Advertising strategies are helpful if you have some basic domain experience
			1. Things like the following are much easier if you actually are interested in the space you are going after
	3. How familiar are you with web technologies?
		1. If not familiar with what's popular, what's not popular, what people use, what's considered good UX, what's considered bad UX, and have not dealt with these things on a daily basis, then look into finding a niche
			1. It is easier to get business from that group - barrier for someone giving you money and accepting project proposal from you is lower
			2. **People assume you're an expert in that space**
			3. Going for a niche is a good idea if you are not confident in your ability to make a snazzy, well polished professional application
		2. When not to pick a niche?
			1. If you don't have a specific pull towards a topic, or technology, try a more generalized approach
			2. If you do not have affiliation to one group of people in your network that you would reach out to in the first stage of launching the business
			3. Cons:
				1. It is not easy to receive interest from other people (they don't see expertise)
			4. Pros:
				1. If you are generalized, you will receive a wider range of interests
					1. But once you have done projects end-to-end a few times, we know whether we want to specialize in an area or if you have a natural area that just works for you that will help you, or you have a natural area that works for you and directs our marketing efforts
3. When to niche:
	1. Strong affliations, passions, or expertise (technology, or domain)
	2. Not web savvy

### Types of subcontractors ###
1. Programmer - Growing skills, efforts, and taking the work to the next level
	1. We cannot clone yourself
		1. For larger or more projects
2. Non-programmer - A business you think you could do well in
	1. You need someone who can make websites for you
3. Subcontracting strategy
	1. Make a decision about Price & Language skills (they are related)
		1. Communication - some of them would communicate effectively and fluidly, while others sound like drunk robots
			1. A contractor with bad communication skills and inconvenient timezones are a lot cheaper
				1. There are exceptions
		2. Each type of contractor changes the dynamics of:
			1. How you deliver projects
			2. How you pitch your projects
			3. How you find clients
		3. Expensive, articulate contractor is going to deliver a higher quality work, but can be much expensive
			1. Can make you push higher prices to your clients
				1. Since your rates are higher, clients will expect higher standard of project quality
					1. It cancels itself out
						1. You charge more, clients ask for more
						2. They are also problably longer term
		4. Bring in other experts, too
			1. Puts top polish on your product
	2. Cheaper freelancers require more of your time
		1. Need to compensate unfront with more effort from your end
		2. You may have to deal with lower product quality
		3. Pros:
			1. Better for margins
				1. A lot healthier
				2. Option to undercut other providers
		4. **Key: Whether or not I can manage them effectively enough to get a good product**
			1. If we can do that, then **price-to-quality ratio** will be fantastic
	3. More expensive, more articulate contractors
		1. We don't have to spend as much time with them
			1. We can spend time on other things - **We don't have to spend more time on project management**

					1. Knowing that at the end of the day you make more money per project
		2. **Consider your experience level** (If answers are yes to the following questions, then we can use **low-cost-high-margin-option**. Otherwise, go for higher-paid contractors who can deal with more, have more autonomy and you focus more on sales)
			1. Do you have a lot of experience working with contractors?
			2. Do you have experience working with team?
			3. Do you speak another language?
			4. Do you have experience being a project manager?
			5. How much experience do you have in web development and web development projects?
	4. Firms vs Freelancers
		1. Firms: They come with management layers
			1. Advantages:
				1. Provides transparency
				2. Provides accountability for projects
				3. Offloads work from you onto them when it comes to day-to-day management
				4. They are much less likely to disappear
				5. They are much less likely to run into problems
				6. If they do run into problems, they're capable of solving it on their own before pulling you into the project
			2. Disadvantages
				1. We are paying for project manager(s)
				2. Firms have a profit line
				3. They are slower to move
					1. They can't drop everything and pick up whatever you need at the moment that you want it
		2. Individuals (freelancers)
			1. Advantages:
				1. Considerably cheaper
				2. Considerably more flexible
				3. If we have experience converting a low-cost freelancer into a high quality work, then this is a good option
				4. If we want to focus on sales, marketing, promotion, branding, ... then we want higher paid, more capable, more communicating freelancer
					1. Leaning towards a firm is a good option, too (can benefit from the management layer)
			2. Disadvantages:
				1. We are the last line of defense if something goes wrong, they get sick, or any problem arises
				2. It requires a lot more management time from you (need more experience)
		3. At the beginning choose between highly paid, more capable, and more communicating, same time-zone freelancers and low paid, less capable, and less communicating, different timezone freelancers
			1. Later on a mix of both can exist to get the best of both worlds
		4. Many options to choose
			1. It's a spectrum
		5. **Price/capability ratio**
			1. **There are cheaper compared to how good they are**
				1. We can mix and match to make a configuration we want

### In-country or out-of-country? ###
1. Two factors apply to picking outsource
	1. What are the resources at your disposal?

	2. What's your experience with this?
		1. Have you outsourced before?
		2. How technical are you?
			1. Do you know how to program?
2. The two factors are inversely related
	1. The more money you have, the more money you are willing to spend
		1. It would imply you are willing to stay in your country
	2. If your budget is tight, you might want to outsource
		1. They are best bang for your buck
			1. You just need to know if you are spending less money, how are you going to make up for it?

### Section 3 Review Material ###

## Section 4: Setting up your presence ##
### Focus on 80/20 solutions for web presence ###
1. The importance of your web presence
	1. When a client or potential client looks at your proposal, they are always going to judge it through the lens of your website
		1. If you have a polished, professional website, they are going to assume that they're product is going to look similar to that (at least in calibre or quality)
		2. They subconsciously judge you based on your website
		3. They are more likely to believe you when you give them a price or when you give them a suggestion on how to improve something or change something.
			1. If you can build a site that beautiful, and that professional, and that valuable, then surely you know exactly what the prices should be and it's going to be
	2. Don't spend all your resources upfront - for making the best web-presence
		1. Sites are very expensive
		2. Online presence follows the 80/20 rule
			1. You can get 80% of effect from 20% of effort
			2. For the remaining 20% polish, you need to spend 80% of the effort
		3. At the beginning, you don't know what your messaging is
			1. You don't know the words
			2. You don't know the concepts
			3. You don't know what ideas resonate with the target market
			4. You don't know what your portfolio is going to look like
			5. You don't know how to display your portfolio
			6. You don't know what your specialization is going to be at the end of the day because it might change
		4. Solution: Start simple and improve over time
			1. To do it cheaply and easily upfront, we use templates
				1. They look amazing and they barely cost anything
					1. Drawback: We do not have much control over customization of the design (you can forget about it in the beginning)
						1. Later: **When you bring in money, you can start to invest in your web presence and start to improve it**
				2. Spend minimum resources to get the best possible web presence you can up front
					1. It is a disproportionate amount of money to improve your web-presence everytime
						1. Improve it when you have more resources
							1. Start of with easy solutions, and improve them over time as you get more feedback and comfortable with the business

### Section 5 Review Material ###

## Section 6: Building a portfolio ##
### Building portfolios upfront ###
1. Portfolios are very important
	1. Every single development firm, or a freelancer has some form of portfolio
		1. It's the way to show what we are capable of and who we work with
	2. Without portfolio, you cannot make a sale
		1. Exceptions: Sale through inside connections
	3. What clients look for 
		1. They see if you have consistent high quality across your portfolio
			1. Out of 5 websites made, each one has to be consistent and good (functionally, pretty)
				1. Otherwise I don't know what I am going to get
			2. Clients see if you can constantly produce the same quality (consistent and slightly lower quality is better than quality that is all over the board)
		2. They see if they can recognize any of the applications or sites you have in it
			1. It's a huge +
			2. If they already use what you built, they will assume you are much more substantial, you are much capable than you may actually are
				1. Higher pedestal
		3. They see if there is any example in the portfolio that is similar to what they are doing - chances are you will build it effectively 
			1. In technical regard
			2. In design regard
			3. ...
			4. 
2. If you select a wide spread of different things, you may get picked
3. You can show them something that is similar
4. **Big companies and clients are going to show 5-10 portfolio items**
	1. **On the client side they are going to look at 5-10 portfolio items**
		1. Once you get to that range, there is no big advantage of being a big company - in terms of portfolio
		2. 100s of items is no point
5. **Show best projects**
6. **Use name**

### Use these tricks to grow your portfolio faster ###
1. Tips and tricks
	1. Clients ask for a portfolio - shows what you built before
		1. Easy ways to build a portfolio
			1. List your own projects
				1. Projects you built yourself, you had built for you - list them
					1. You had an intimate relationship with product - output has to do with you
						1. Annotate the parts
						2. Show the entire website
							1. Specify what you did if they ask you
				2. Portfolios show what you're capable of making
			2. Use your contractor's portfolio
				1. You can build assuming you are going to be using a contractor
				2. Show what the firms can build
				3. Show what you can do. Not what you built yourself
				4. It's a growth hack
				5. A stop-gap strategy
			3. Improve it over time
				1. To projects you did in totality
				2. Look for consistency

### Thoughts about portfolios ###
1. Common mistakes
	1. Don't show everything
		1. People judge you by your worst item - they think that way
		2. Take smaller portfolio that's curated - keep the better ones
		3. Keep the quality consistent
		4. For development projects: People are biased towards good graphic design
			1. Poor graphic design or poor UX will make it look bad
				1. Purchase decision makers are also consumers
				2. They are going to select something that looks good to their users
				3. **Pick something that looks good than the one that shows your technical prowess**
				4. **Show the complex ones if asked**
			2. **Focus on simple but better looking items**
			3. **Expand but keep quality consistent**

### Section 6 Review Material ###

## Section 7: Getting clients ##
### Strategy: Email scrape and blast ###
1. How to find similarities among clientale and client profiles
	1. Client profile: A group that is most likely to purchase from you to become clients
		1. Analyze the group of people and see if we can find something in common with them, and something in common can be used to find them in mass or in some type of an index
2. dunked.com
	1. Hammer down to "Who is your ideal customer base?"
		1. Who responds to your message the most?
		2. What are the commonalities between those groups of people?
			1. What do they have in common?
		3. Example: Graphic designers - worked for them and they brought clients. It worked out - secondary market
			1. It depends on value proposition - Cheap & Good
			2. Looked for groups specifically attracted to you
		4. dunked.com:
			1. It helps freelancers who are designers to set up their portfolios online
			2. Large user-base of potential clients
			3. They give templated website
				1. They have similarities
					1. 91k graphic designers
				2. Hard search: "Powered by dunked" (exact text)
		5. nerdydata.com - for searching source code (not given by google)
			1. Search: powered by dunked (searches in code)
			2. Download
			3. Go through their websites and contact them
		6. What do the clients have in common (think about their web presence)
			1. Example: Wordpress plugin might probably has same code in it
				1. Use it to search people who are using that plugin
					1. You get people using the plugin (grouping strategy)
					2. You can work on fixing a broken plugin
3. firmlist.com
	1. Look for already created directories (indexes, or lists)
		1. Exmaples:
			1. Small businesses of certain size
			2. They might be marketing agencies
				1. Can google with that combination
	2. They list out graphic design and web-development companies
		1. Pick an area - Idaho
		2. Pick town
		3. Contact the companies
	3. **See who's a niche**
		1. Check if someone has a list of the niche
		2. We can also purchase lists for marketing
		3. Google: Your niche + email list
			1. See where they work and if they are indexed
	4. upwork.com
		1. Easy to find in specific areas and contact them
	5. After finding ways of contacting them, generate a list, and use it for marketing

### Strategy: Offer adjacent services to those trying to hire in house ###
1. Offering adjacent services to potential clients
	1. Going after people who might be interested in what you want but they haven't declared that they are interested
2. Adjacent marketing
	1. If we are running a development firm, we are directly marketing to people who need development services
		1. We look for people who posted projects online
		2. People who have startups or entrepreneurs and typically look for contractors
		3. Think of people who need adjacent needs
		4. They are perhaps looking for employees
	2. We go after people who need the same thing but they want it a different way
		1. We can get in front of them and find a way for pitching your services and using that as an avernue for converting sales and getting clients
			1. **Look for someone who needs programming help but is more interested in an employee**
		2. Craigslist - job posting board
			1. Others:
				1. Monster.com
				2. ladders.com
			2. jobs
				1. Web info design
					1. Look for people who need something you can do
				2. Software design
				3. ...

								1. 1 will be delivered
				5. Responces is lower
					1. 4-5 good leads
			4. Try to get your website into other people who roughly needs the same thing

### Strategy: Discount offers to groups ###
1. Sponsoring groups
	1. Go after groups of people that might fit your client profile and offer to sponsor the group or give discount offers to the group
		1. Sponsor - a way to get advertising (otherwise it is expensive in the beginning, expensive to test)
			1. Co-opting their email group
			2. Effective way to reach out
				1. meetup.com
					1. Local area
					2. Group that has relevancy to what we do
					3. Example:
						1. Real Estate
							1. Pick a group
								1. Check if their interests align with what we are offering
								2. Email -
									1. I am interested in what your group does
									2. I am interested in offering discounted services to your group
										1. They might promote your offering to the group
										2. Discount
											1. Depends on business model
											2. How aggressive we want to be with the strategy
									3. Perks
										1. Meetups use the term
											1. Small business groups who are interested in the meetup groups can offer perks (discount, free something, free consultation, ...)
											2. Perks are added informally
												1. Say: I want to add a perk to your group
													1. Free work for sponsorship
													2. Free services to the group
				2. Another way: Conventions
					1. Pay for sponsorship or pay for reduced rate
					2. Real-estate: Search real estate convention
						1. realtor.org
						2. ureconvention.com
					3. Message them and it depends on what they find valuable
					4. hustlecon.com
						1. Group of non-technical entrepreneurs - they are looking to develop their skills as non-tech entrepreneurs
							1. Sponsored emails
							2. Paying for visiblity
							3. Offering discount to the group and being listed somewhere
							4. Offering free services
				3. Another way: careeronestop.org
					1. Aggregator
					2. List of different groups by occupation
						1. Graphic designers
						2. Real estate
							1. Professional associations
								1. They are easier to get in contact with
								2. They are local
								3. They are very engaged - easier way of offering a win-win
								4. Direct links to websites
				4. Another way: Take area we are in - search for it
					1. Chamber of commerce
						1. Economic development group
							1. They list out business organizations and business groups - they are responsible to connect to them
						2. sfchamber.com
							1. Find a business
							2. Look for events - look for sponsorship
								1. Small leads

						3. Open to offering discounted services to group members

						1. Focus on little investment (0 cash is best)
						2. Focus on winning leads
					3. **Have a template email and change it depending on whether we are sending to a meetup group or professional association**

### Strategy: Use your affiliations ###
1. Go to strategy
	1. Use affiliations - anything we are associated with - good starting point to look for clients
		1. College
		2. University
		3. Country, state, city
		4. Workgroups, professional groups
		5. Previous company
		6. Membership
	2. Why does it work?
		1. People judge you based on affiliation
			1. Pitch from affiliation is more valued
			2. The more points in your favour, the more likely you are going to close the contract
				1. You can also raise your price if you have more points in your favour
				2. We can also get picky about clients and how much we charge them
		2. At the beginning, we do not have enough points
			1. Affiliation givs you an advantage (a leg up)
				1. Example: Collage mates
		3. Affiliation increases trust
		4. While pitching, make them understand what your affiliation is
			1. Example: Using your college email to reach out to your college mates (more trust)
	3. Specialize or have a good idea of where you are going to find customers
	4. Affiliation strength
		1. Being Americans is not a great affiliation
		2. City - stronger (same community, we could potentially do something if something went wrong)
	5. **Think about all the affiliations you have** - use them as a launching point (easier to close sales, to get interest, and get them to trust you, if they have a strong association with you - feeling of community is strong)
		1. Meetup groups
		2. Professional organizations
		3. NGOs (anytime in your life)
		4. ...

### Strategy: Tag your work ###
1. Tag your work
	1. Something that has name
2. Exampel: Powered by ...
	1. Anything built for free
3. Exchange for tagging
	1. Offer to reduce the price for new client to tag their work 
	2. Offer free work in exchange to plug themselves
4. If you believe that your client is going to have a decent amount of traffic or the type of client that are going to see your work are going to be the right customer base 
	1. Offer a deal
		1. People associate it with you
			1. They can also click through to your link
		2. It helps in SEO
			1. The site has a backlink to your website
				1. Google thinks that your site is important because a lot of people are referring to you
5. It some cases it does nothing
	1. Tagging strategy: Pick one out of 3 or 5 clients and tag
		1. Great at the beginning - especially with NGOs
		2. Larger clients don't like tagging
			1. You can find out if you can put your banner at the bottom, ...
			2. Mid-tier clients allows you to mention in their blog or in text (non-obtrusive)
			3. Big clients don't allow - confuses from a branding perspective, it looks cheap (that they owe you a favor)
6. **Use it only when you know that the crowd that they will receive is very specific to the client-base you are going after, or if it is not a financial risk (a really small job, or using only lean development hours to do)**
7. Some might work and some might not

### Strategy: Selling things that require maintenance ###
1. Strategy to help you close early contracts early on in your business
2. Strategy:
	1. Sell things that require maintenance (ongoing work)
		1. Rationalize it by giving heavier discount upfront because over time it's going to pay itself of
			1. Good if you know that whatever you are doing requires updating, maintainance, going to get expanded but the client is not thinking about that
		2. Example: Wordpress
			1. Customers need more customization than Wordpress can offer
				1. Easy to charge additionally
				2. Easy to suggest to clients becaus the price of changes is low
		3. Startups will have ongoing work
			1. Subsidise the price upfront
			2. Establish that they trust you
			3. We can work with them and benefit from the dividends along the road as they update it
				1. Versions
				2. Iterations - based on user feedback
	2. **It's an upselling strategy**
		1. Getting the client is the hardest part
		2. Once we work with them, getting more work from them or having them choose you as preferred vendor, it's easier
		3. **Get over the barrier of acceptance that a new client has**

### Strategy: This sucks, let me fix it ###
1. It works for small and big companies
2. Experiment with different marketing strategies at the beginning
3. "This is bad let me fix it"
	1. **When we look at people's portfolios, and sites, we get sensitive about quality**
		1. We get sensitive about how they do certain things, what's considered good and bad
	2. **Websites have the same issues usually**
		1. **Offer to fix them**
			1. Example:
				1. Contact form doesn't work
				2. Something that doesn't look right (images overlapping, mismatches in typography, ...)
	3. **Big return on investment**
		1. We can send them customized emails saying I can fix it and this is the price
	4. **Point out what can be improved**
		1. Keep things in mind that are easy to do or are time intensive
		2. People may be interested
		3. Example: Some people don't know how to install email capture forms
			1. We don't have to customize emails but send them to whoever needs it
		4. Works well for niche (real-estate say)
			1. This section is bad
			2. Something is not working
			3. It's much better if I install this for you 
			4. Photos are formatted incorrectly
			5. What to say: Hey, I can install this and it costs 10 hours at $40 per hour
		5. If they are not interested, you can get referrals
			1. They might keep in touch with you
			2. Returning work - how often will they give you work in the future

### Strategy: The perpetual discount ###
1. Perpetual discounting - marketing term
	1. Example: They display high prices, then run massive discounts (how they sell most of their courses)
		1. Buying a $400 course for $10 gives an optical illusion that it is more valuable or I am getting more discount
	2. Scoring points with your potential clients
		1. You need something to draw them towards you
			1. Having them think that they are getting a discount is a good thing
				1. Offer rates based off of types of clients
					1. One charge for corporate accounts
					2. One charge for startups
					3. One charge for freelancers
					4. One charge for non-profits
					5. ...
				2. **Inflate prices, then discount** - sweeten the offer
					1. Is it dishonest?
						1. We can say our per-hour cost is this and if there's a client we really want, or we think something is a good portfolio item we'd enjoy working on, we give them a discount (quite often)
							1. It's a true discount
						2. It is better to offer a higher anchor price - it is the perceived value - it gives more room to lower the price
							1. It helps in closing deals
							2. It may not attract interest - can be used to attract clients later on
						3. **Discounts help in negotiations**
							1. After we have tried everything - give a great portfolio, personlized proposal, above and beyond answering all their questions, you are sometimes lost beyond a point - then discounts
								1. Higher rate gives more wiggle room
									1. If someone pays higher rate, that's good
									2. If not, we can come down
							2. Don't go wild with discounts - helps potential customers to go over the hump

### Strategy: Build something and give it away ###
1. Give something away for free
	1. Sometimes we find that people give away potent things for free
		1. Development businesses
			1. **Establishes that you are competent**
				1. It shows of to the person that you can master the technology or a good understanding of how that tech works - we can construct it on our own and confident to give it away for free
			2. **You make contact with a lot of people**
				1. Raises your profile
				2. People might have heard of you if you give away something that is popular
				3. It gets you automatic entry to getting into conversation all over the world
			3. Do the following for potential clients who has problems:
				1. **Pick a tool that could be helpful**
				2. **Do some research on something that you think could be helpful** 
				3. **Make guides** (simpler)
					1. Link to popular tools
					2. Ways to fix problems
					3. ...
	2. Example: For developer community
		1. Build something that solves hard problems
			1. Free tool
	3. Example: Real estate
		1. Make their lives easier
			1. Build a tool to make it easy to share photos of their spaces
			2. Make a tool that automatically displays available houses in the market on a map
	4. You could do something that is simple (because of development expertise and capacity) for you that other people find it complicated
	5. **Tips**
		1. **Think about what group to sell to**
		2. **Think about the problem they have**
		3. **Think about how to solve it using a web / mobile tool**
	6. To be successful:
		1. **Understand well the potential customer**
		2. **Identify their [small] problems that we can solve**
			1. Go after a problem that everyone in your customer-base could potentially have (not just a standard solution for one person)
				1. Example: Graphic designers
					1. Bargaining for each other's work
						1. Built a portfolio tool - gave it for free
	7. People love free things
		1. Builds trust
	8. Less negative reaction for free things
		1. Even if they don't know you, they have no report with you
	9. Positive effects
		1. Could be trojan horse
			1. Get your name out there and make it popular

### Strategy: Making tutorials strategy ###
1. Why do people make tutorials?
	1. Great way of promoting yourself
		1. Some freelancers use it to drive traffic back to their site
			1. They want to get their name out
			2. Paves way for more tutorial vidoes
			3. Helps sell to make money off of
	2. Development business
		1. Pick something that you're good at and make a tutorial
			1. Videos
			2. Blog posts
				1. In-depth
	3. Ways to choose what to do
		1. Pick something you are expert in
			1. YouTube vide, blog-post, guide, ...
			2. Generic technical skill that relates to you
				1. We could use a contractor to make them make a tutorial
					1. New framework
					2. Platform update
					3. Explain something that's very technical in a way that a non-technical person can understand
						1. How facebook works, say
			3. Advantages
				1. You become an authority figure in the specific realm
					1. Example: 
						1. Ways to write your code better
						2. Ways to use funky scripts
						3. Ways to integrate something popular
				2. People will trust you more
				3. It generates a lot of traffic
					1. A lot of people would be coming to your website for reasons other than web-development
						1. Getting someone to purchase something from you is a higher barrier
							1. It is hard to distinguish yourself from the thousands of other firms
						2. If they like your tutorial, they will have positive thoughts about your company
							1. If they are interested in the future with web-development services, they might come back to you
								1. The barrier for them to pay you money is much lower
						3. They might hold you in a better light than just a service provider
							1. Warm call - There's context for you talking to them
								1. They hold you in a positive way
							2. Cold call - no relationship and they immediately know that you have something to sell to them
		2. Pick something your client-base or niche cares about
			1. Think about the niche and the problems they have
				1. Might be technical
				2. Problems I could easily solve and publish how to do it
					1. Simple problems that could be solve if there were a guide
						1. Example: Real-estate company
							1. Guide to a popular Wordpress plugin that helps real-estate companies do some function
								1. Email all of their prospective clients
								2. Helps them embed images of properties into emails
								3. Advanced searching on real-estate database
								4. (anything that gets the attention of specific group of people)
									1. They can view you as a technology company that knows things and you are there to help them
							2. Somebody might recognize you because you had a lot of tutorials online
			2. It could only take you 30m to make
				1. 1000-2000 views next year
				2. You will get some buzz around your name
				3. You might show off that you are good at something

### Section 7 Review Material ###

## Section 8: Building proposals ##
### Types of proposals ###
1. Proposals
	1. Very crucial to development businesses you run
		1. You propose a certain amount of work to your client
		2. They will view that and approve, deny, or try to get an adjustment on whatever you proposed to them
2. How does it work?
	1. When you meet a client, you will go over their idea or what they are going to build
		1. We first start very vague - they start with generic terms
		2. We do back and forth to hammer out what it is they are exactly trying to build
		3. We give them some proposal
3. Types of proposals
	1. Casual
	2. Semi-formal
	3. Complex / formal
4. How important are proposals?
	1. Very important
		1. Can make or break the deal
		2. Clients might be shopping for other vendors
		3. It's a final opportunity to show them that you understand their project the best and that you are proposing the best possible solution
5. Proposals are meant to be shared
6. Proposals are formatted in a way that can be shown to other decision makers related to the client or client organizations
7. **Spend time working on a proposal and make sure you follow basic tenets**
8. When to use which type and what is each type good for
	1. Casual
		1. Off the cuff proposal
			1. No outside material
			2. No outside documentation
			3. Something we did in a very quick manner 
			4. Estimate is not very detailed
				1. Usually a range
			5. Usually done with projects that are very small
			6. No fancy PDF
			7. No template with a cover page 
			8. No uploading to a site and sending it
			9. Content
				1. Answering their questions
				2. Quick rundown of what it would take 
				3. Give a general idea of the estimate
				4. No phone call (it's only for reference)
		2. 1-4 paragraphs
		3. On the fly, no documentation - no presentation value
		4. Why?
			1. The proposal is not large enough to spend time on it
				1. Small projects
				2. A $200 project doesn't need an elaborate proposal
			2. They can be strategic
				1. Shows client that it's not a big project and it's not a big deal and let me show you how easy it is
				2. Doesn't let them percieve the project as huge
				3. No much paper work
					1. If client has to do more for starting development means they are taking it more seriously
					2. It gives them more opportunity to realize how much money they have to spend
						1. They might feel they have to work with a different vendor or change it or shelf the project
			3. It removes friction
				1. It indicates that if they want to go bigger and more in-depth and complex estimation, then show interest and we can format it for you
			4. Can be given to those who we worked with before
				1. They already know you and they don't need to be convinced
	2. Semi-Formal
		1. We give an estimation in email but attached to that we give an in-depth estimation
			1. Email acts as cover letter
				1. Details about what we think about the proposal
				2. Detail out the timelines
				3. Detail out total hours
				4. Usually has longer explanations
				5. My thoughts (only if we have worked with the client before)
				6. Explaining how we do development and use agile
					1. Graphic design
					2. Tablet or mobile compatible
					3. ...
			2. Detailed estimation
				1. More technical
				2. Granular details of
					1. What will be built
					2. How much is it going to cost
					3. When is it going to get done
					4. More comprehensive
	3. Complex / Formal
		1. For large projects
			1. That require multiple people to buy into the project
				1. They may not be the only person
					1. The others could be
						1. Partners
						2. Project team
						3. Boss
				2. They need something to show off or present to other people
		2. What does it use?
			1. Template
			2. Cover page
			3. Complex - most detail possible
		3. It can take a serious amount of time - 1/2 a day say
		4. When to use?
			1. Big projects
			2. Medium projects we are confident we can close
		5. Content
			1. Branded
			2. Many pages (10)
			3. PDF
			4. Graphic design involved
			5. A lot of Auxilliary and supporting information
				1. Introduction from CEO
				2. Introduction to what the firm does
				3. More specific info
				4. Timeline
				5. Budjets
				6. References, contacts, core team
9. When we meet clients, they ask for proposals

### Components of proposals ###
1. Components (complex proposals - for larger projects, or serious projects)
	1. About you - about a page (1/2 a page is okay)
		1. Who they are (as a person)
			1. Human element
				1. Makes them attached to
					1. Otherwise
						1. Cold 
						2. Transactional
						3. Business
		2. How they work
		3. What they choose to do
		4. How they like to present themselves
		5. Who they worked for before
	2. Overview of the project
		1. Upto page
		2. Pitching the project back to the client
			1. Ensures that we undertand what they want to be built
			2. To show if we have understood it
			3. To show if there are any missing gaps in knowledge
		3. Shows how well we understand the project
		4. Tricky
			1. Too short - opposite effect (may make them feel you don't know about the project at all)
				1. Do background research
					1. Questions
						1. Why do they want to build it?
						2. What issues are they facing?
						3. What issues do they want to fix?
						4. Do we have all the assumptions correct?
	3. How you work
		1. Explain Agile and the benefits
			1. Practice
		2. Describe individual step-by-step process
			1. How we intake info
			2. Updating info
			3. What technologies we will use
			4. Your philosophies
			5. What strategies we use
		3. Types
			1. Relaxed, professional
			2. Cutting edge
			3. ...
		4. Keep them informed about what you are doing and the next steps
	4. Timeline
		1. How long the project is going to take (important)
			1. Even if client is flexible
		2. We can give a range
		3. Don't give too much detail and keep it flexible - otherwise it might be a problem
	5. Price
		1. Breakdown as much as possible
		2. Number one page - they disect
		3. Don't be vague (not just one line)
		4. Breakdown - technologies, ...
		5. Get more information to be able to breakdown
	6. Next steps
		1. If the client accepts the proposal, this is what we are going to do
			1. Talk about
				1. Payment terms
				2. When we need payment
					1. It depends on when we are going to work and when we are going to deliver it
				3. What you need and when you need it (graphic files, ...)
		2. Make them feel it's upto them and everything is ready to go
	7. Disclaimers
		1. If this changes, then the estimates will change
		2. If this happens, the timelines might change
		3. It protects you if you make a statement, it is not exactly true
		4. Important
			1. If any new features are added or any process is changed, we will re-evaluate the price and it might change
			2. Timeline: If we are not familiar with a technology, the timeline is based on us assuming that it is reasonable and easy to implement
				1. If it is not, the timeline might be delayed
					1. Indicate which sections might blow up and become larger
				2. You need to plan for extra time
	8. Case studies (optional)
		1. 5 out of 10 pages
			1. Powerful tool - shows what you are capable of and clients you worked with
		2. It is rare - it is benefit
		3. It makes proposal too long
			1. Client may not finish the proposal
			2. It is distraction
			3. Alternative - On website, another pdf (portfolio, who we are)
		4. Include 1 or 2 case-studies that are relevant to what we are building
			1. Similar applications
				1. It worked well
				2. They are happy about us
				3. We worked on it before
				4. ...
		5. Don't add case studies that have nothing to do with their project
			1. Distraction
			2. You don't understand their project well
	9. Development contract (optional)
		1. Frequently used
		2. Add contract into the proposal
			1. It doesn't work well
				1. Very long proposal document
				2. Very wordy legalized document attached
				3. It may not add value to the proposal
					1. Proposal's purpose is to convince the client that you are the best option for the project
						1. You know what you are doing
						2. You have thought about the project
						3. You have necessary skills 
						4. You have done it before
		3. It is discussed only after they say they are okay to work with you
			1. Contracts are not easy to understand
			2. It has details that you may not understand
		4. Don't give this in order to remove friction
			1. Make it easy for them with next steps and what you need from them
2. Example: Akta

### Types of estimates ###
1. Ways of estimating - Different ways
	1. All together
		1. Most common
		2. Simpler
		3. Saves time
		4. Good if the client knows exactly what you are delivering
		5. No discussion about what we are doing
		6. If the client trusts you
	2. Section by section
		1. Break down what we are going to do into major sections
			1. Example:
				1. Logging in
				2. Messaging users
				3. ...
			2. 2-10 section
				1. Price per section
		2. Gives an idea to the client the sections that are larger and those that are smaller
		3. It takes a bit of time
			1. No task wise splitting
	3. Piece by piece
		1. Break down into tasks and sub-tasks
			1. sub-tasks for each feature
		2. Naturally lends into agile
			1. We may need to estimate how long each feature is going to take upfront (how long each feature might take)
			2. They determine what features to build in a batch of work (in each Sprint)
			3. We also estimate
				1. How long it's going to take to upload files to a server
				2. How long it takes to fix a bug
			4. We add anything that can be estimated
		3. Pros:
			1. Give client more visilibility, more transparency, ...
				1. They know exactly what each section takes
				2. They know exactly what each feature takes
					1. They know that some things are smaller while other things are larger
			2. It shows clients we know what we are talking about
		4. Cons:
			1. Takes more time
			2. Opens you up to criticism to your client
				1. Semi-technical clients may challenge you on individual pieces if you over-estimate
2. Tips
	1. Give as much information as possible
	2. Keep the information clear and easy to understand
	3. It must be digestable
		1. No sticker shock
		2. No hour shock

### Our technique in depth costs of everything ###
1. Example:
	1. Feature:
		1. Tasks 
			1. Subtasks
	2. Piece by piece can win clients
		1. Clients love piece by piece estimates
			1. Gives transparency
			2. Wins trust
			3. They know what it takes
			4. We know what it takes
		2. **Show off as much as you can**
		3. We can add additional features
			1. Potential features/optional tasks
			2. We can add additional estimates
				1. Makes upselling easier
				2. Makes it easier to explain to clients what's useful and what's optional
					1. Helps clients save their funds from sections that abnoramally large and put them where they are small
						1. Pros: **Ties project to the success of the client (we don't want client to run out of money)**
		4. People like detail
			1. An edge over competition
			2. Educates the client
			3. Connects clients to what we are making
			4. It shows what we are talking about
			5. Helps them convince other people
			6. They become serious about it
		5. Structure
			1. Task (feature, setup)
				1. Server setup
				2. Packaging
				3. Building a feature
				4. Submitting to stores
				5. ...
			2. Sub task 
				1. Breakup of task into smaller pieces (may not be accurate so indicate that it is a draft)
			3. Back-end
			4. Front-end
			5. iOS
			6. Android
			7. Windows Phone
			8. Blackberry
			9. Notes
				1. Comments
					1. Doubts
					2. More info required
					3. Clarification
					4. Why 0 until we get more info 
		7. Doesn't take too much time
		8. Sub-contractors can also make it
		9. We can give rough estimate and refine later

				4. Proposal editor - we can choose a theme
					1. Other serious themes
						1. Themes are easthetic
				5. Preloaded sections
					1. We can add or remove sections
				6. Tools

				8. Online proposal
					1. Signature box for client to sign (only if contract is attached)
						1. Contract
							1. Timeline
							2. Work
							3. Estimates
							4. Exibit A and B - binding terms
			2. Snapshotting
				1. Watch a timeline of what happened to proposal
				2. How many times it opened
				3. What sections you are stuck on
				4. Who signed and who hasn't
				5. Send reminders
			3. Metrics
				1. Keep track of how many get closed - feedback for us
				2. View metrics (feedback)

### How much do you customize ###
1. Topics:
	1. How big is the project?
		1. Longer to close big projects and longer sales cycle and very few of them
			1. Do we focus on fewer big projects
			2. Typically have a lot of competition
				1. Customization may be required and it might be challenging to close it
					1. It may not be worth spending the time at the higher tier
		2. Small projects come and go quickly
			1. Do we want to focus on small projects?
				1. Go for customization - impresses the clients
					1. It can be easily closed
	2. 60 / 40 rule
		1. When in doubt, do this
			1. 60% - custom or tailored to the project
			2. 40% - copy paste
		2. Most of the proposal is templated
		3. Don't assume that audience will be captivated by the proposal and will read every single page
			1. Atleast 60% should get customized and tailored to them so that their attention span is longer
			2. 40% we can get away with in the beginning
			3. Later on, we will have case studies, projects etc to showcase, so the proposal will get better and better
		4. Don't be a firm that sends 90% duplicate content
			1. Be specific to the project
				1. Keep it relevant
				2. They need to know you understand their project, what they need, etc.
					1. Don't pitch yourself as a generic provider
			2. Templated pages may be unnecessary
2. How much to customize vs copy paste
	1. Copy paste - efficient
3. Customize more at the beginning
	1. Helps stick out from the rest of the crowd
	2. It helps get traction early on - biggest problem at the beginning
		1. Once we get traction, it's a snowball effect

### Ballpark estimates versus exacto ###
1. Estimation strategy - increasing conversion rate
	1. The "ballpark estimate" strategy
		1. Full estimates take time
		2. When someone describes an idea, we get as much information as we can
		3. We can come up with a range (could be very wide)
			1. First number could be 1/2 of the second number
		4. Why?
			1. They give clients an idea of the size - ballpark estimate answers the question quickly
				1. It's a skill to estimate the range the price will fall in
			2. Not a lot of people do this
				1. Clients will hear from your first (when other proposals come in, they already have your quick estimate)
				2. You can give explanations as to why it is that range
			3. It's a time saving technique
				1. We get ahead of competition
					1. We can give something very quickly
	2. Don't give estimates on the spot
		1. Work on it
		2. Give a wide range
			1. 200 Hours to 400 Hours - It gives some idea of how big their project is
		3. Make it clear that any changes will affect the range
			1. If they add features, they should know that it will increase the price
			2. Otherwise, they might think that you are shady in some way
	3. It takes a while to get them right
	4. Accepting the range means they have the budget
	5. They might have more raport with you

### Strategy: Introduce ideas and see if they stick ###
1. To increase project sizes and customer lifetime value of each client
2. Ways of grwoing your business
	1. Work with same clients but more valuable projects
	2. An engine that attracts more clients
	3. Focus on retention - keep a client for a long period of time
3. For increasing lifetime value of your clients or increasing value of each individual project, apply
	1. Constant estimation
		1. Example: Upselling - graphic designers offer something else at a discounted rate, bundling something at a reduced cost, ...
		2. We deliver chunks of work at a time
			1. When we send out an email with what we have published or is demoable, **include extra estimations**
				1. The client might forgo certain features, they might include other features, they might add extra layers of security or technology
				2. When the clients prioritize features, they often don't know the estimates of each individual pieces
					1. A feature might seem huge and not worth it, but it might be simpler and might cost less
		3. **Constantly look at extra things they do and shoot to include estimations as an afterthought at the end of every single sprint**
			1. Example: These are the extra things that could help and how many hours they are going to take
				1. Don't push
				2. Just give options
					1. It helps them with their product roadmap
						1. They might add more and more features to their roadmap
							1. Helps with prioritization
			2. **Only pick things they mention or curious about or things been used in similar applications**
				1. Example: These are things we've seen other people use and it didn't take much time to estimate it out, so we just included it
					1. Product managers think about what else could be included in the product and how expensive it is

### Section 8 Review Material ###

## Section 9: Managing clients ##
### How to keep the right amount of distance ###
1. Keeping both clients and you happy
	1. Keeping the right amount of distance between you and client
	2. Responsiveness is good, but what does it entail? (personal effect is good)
		1. Stand-up call - quick update call
			1. We could be there for 3 clients
				1. What if you grow fast? 
					1. It overburdens us or break the promises with clients
		2. **Can you promise based on client load during the course of the project?**
			1. **Underpromise, then suprise them** 
				1. If we don't as many clients as we thought we were going to, we will have extra time
				2. If we are hit with avalanche, then we can at least keep our promise
	3. **Keeping the right distance**
		1. Too much distance, or too much intimacy is not good
			1. We need to guage based on what a client is comfortable with
				1. Needy vs relaxed clients
					1. Some clients are there everyday and if they send text messages, they expect us to respond within a certain time
					2. Some clients are opposite. They might ask you to come back when it is perfect.
			2. Know where client falls
				1. Easy to understand it
					1. Do they get agitated when you don't respond on time?
					2. Do they have a framework of checkins they want to enforce?
		2. Two ways
			1. Guage the client's needs
				1. Are they really needy?
					1. Try to figure out before the project starts
			2. Set the tone yourself
				1. As a project manager you can:
					1. Say when the updates are going to be
					2. Set the tone for how much information they are going to get
					3. Set the tone for how often we are going to update them
				2. **Clients default to your judgement**
					1. You know how often information is available to present to them
					2. You know how often we need feedback for the project to be successful
					3. Clients know that too much communication can be a detriment to the project
				3. **Try to make them feel like they are in the loop**
					1. Depends on: Where in the spectrum do they fall
					2. Everyday to a month
					3. **Enforce your own schedule**
						1. **Push it towars what's reasonable amount for your workload and project load**
				4. **Tell them the schedule upfront**
					1. Tell them this is how we work
						1. We can customize it for the project
							1. Check-in time
							2. Schedule
					2. Tell them before signing the deal
						1. If they protest, be considerate
						2. If they ask too much, explain to them the reasons
							1. How much time it takes to give the updates
							2. It could be a detriment to the project if you make it too frequent
								1. You might have nothing to say
									1. **Every Friday night is a good frequency**
	4. Don't spread too thin
		1. Respect the schedule given to the client

### Confidence is key ###
1. How you talk to clients is important
	1. Confidence is important
	2. Clients risk a lot by hiring you
		1. Job could be on the line
	3. They want to feel as if they're in the right hands
		1. **Be consistently confident**
			1. Be confident with estimates (also mention it could change)
				1. Also indicate where you expect variation
			2. Don't insert unnecessary questions or question marks
				1. They want to know that you are authority figure
					1. They want you to feel like you know everything
			3. Keep them feeling assured
	4. What do you do when a problem happens?
		1. Miscommunication
		2. Scheduling issue
		3. Bug
		4. Something in your development gets delayed
		5. Response:
			1. Problem: Explain what happened, apologize, tell them everything that's wrong and leave it open ended
				1. Solution:
					1. Tell them the problem
						1. Let them know about it
					2. Let them know how big of a problem it is
					3. Tell them when it will be fixed
						1. If you don't know when it will be fixed, then at least let them know when you will know it will be fixed
							1. There is ambiguity - Reword it to make it definitive
								1. Focus on what you know
				2. **Never say it cannot be fixed**
					1. It can be fixed and give a timeline
						1. Give them a timeline as to when you can get back to them with a timeline to fix
						2. **Combat it with specificity**
							1. **Tell the team exactly what the issue is**
							2. **Show the team why it is hard**
								1. They will eventually empathise with you
								2. Explain to them why it is a difficult technical problem
								3. Explain to them **how experienced the person is looking at it and they have never seen this before**
									1. It could be a problem with the platform
									2. It could be a problem with the technology
										1. It can possibly be not your fault
							3. **Say that it is a hard problem, and it can be fixed, if they believe you it is good**
					2. **Always act like you have a plan**
						1. Even if you don't know what to do
							1. Buy enough time before correctly answering their questions
						2. **In development, there is no problem that cannot be solved in some way**
							1. If otherwise, you should have seen that way before
				3. **What if you don't have the asnwer to a client's question**
					1. Mention the timeline when the answer will be figured out
						1. Give them confidence that you can figure it out
							1. They questions will not be so challenging that you cannot answer them
							2. You could give them a vague timeline
								1. Couple days
								2. We can get into it when we are at this section
								3. ...
2. Takeways
	1. Confidence is key
		1. Hold their hands
		2. Clients are poorely equipped to handle problems
		3. Clients are poorely equipped to tell who's on the right path and who's wrong
		4. Clients tell who is confident and who's not
			1. Issues they are confident that you can figure it out (even if you cannot fix the problem), it is a better solution
		5. Be their north star
		6. Don't give open ended answers
			1. Always give a conclusion or summation (it's a problem and we can fix it quickly or tomorrow we will know how to fix it)

### Just enough jargon ###
1. How much jargon to use?
	1. Jargon: Technical words
		1. Clients may not understand it
	2. Minimize jargon as much as possible - simplistic
		1. Don't use too much jargon
			1. Confuses the client - it shows that you are a poor communicator
				1. The way you speak to a developer is different
					1. Speaking in jargons is not the effective way to speak to even technical clients
					2. Too little jargon has negative effects - makes it sound like you are not an expert
						1. It might sound like it is a simple project - they may not be willing to pay so much
						2. Too simple speach might make them feel like your position or role in the communication is unnecessary
				2. Use a medium amount of jargon
					1. **Use words and code names that are most common.**
						1. Leave out things that are less common
						2. For actions: Use simpler verbs
						3. For objects/technologies/platforms: use specific language
							1. It makes it sound like you are domain expert
								1. Gives a feeling that they have hired an expert (it might sound complicated)
	3. Example:
		1. Scenario: Trying to save, getting an error
			1. Answer: Don't look like baby
				1. Make them feel like they are talking to a technical person
				2. Don't introduce concepts they have never heard of
					1. Don't explain the exact phenomenon
					2. Don't explain the exact technology
				3. Use a little bit of jargon and make it understandable
	4. **A little bit of jargon: Respect and trust**
		1. They can believe you
		2. Don't make it sound too simple or that you are a poor communicator

### Sniffing out their budget ###
1. At the beginning
	1. There's a lot of back and forth to understand
		1. What you are building
		2. How much it costs
		3. What your timelines are going to be
			1. Larger projects have more of it
	2. Clients drop out due to budget
		1. They either don't have the budget, they are not confident that they will get the money, they don't have enough money
		2. Sometimes they have the money but they need to scale down
	3. Why you should know their budget?
		1. You can shift resources if you believe the client is unrealistic
		2. You can change strategy
			1. Push towards things that are practical and more cost effective
				1. MVP model
					1. They can start of smaller
		3. They might accept the project but do not have funds sometimes
			1. They might spend all money and don't have budget for edits, fixes, user feedback, ... 
				1. It's a dead project
	4. **Never ask about the budget upfront**
		1. Bad manners
		2. Don't show interest only in their money
			1. Bad for long-term projects
				1. Make your client feel that you are interested in what they are doing
				2. Make it seem like money is not an important issue
		3. People try to fit their estimate near budget
			1. Dishonesty
2. Simple ways to find out their budget (without being explicit)
	1. They assure you that their project is really simple (or cheap)
		1. They usually don't know how big a project is - they are more often wrong
		2. It's a signal that budget is a concern
	2. Look for how much specificity they give you
		1. A client that gives you 16-20 pages of documentation (wireframes, specification, ...) is probably more realistic and aware how big the project is
		2. They probably have the budget to pay for the project
			1. They are confident they can pay for it after all the diligence
		3. Simple emails that ask you to build instagram probably don't have an idea how much it is going to cost
			1. Less likely to have the budget
	3. I vs We
		1. We: There are multiple people participating in making decision (partners, ...)
			1. Pooling money
				1. Probably more disposable income
	4. Consider how much you know about the client
		1. If people are doing on the side with a fulltime job
			1. Probably confident about how much it is going to cost and they might be putting money on the side to pay for it
		2. College kid
			1. They may not be realistic
				1. They may not know how much it is going to cost
	5. How quicly do they go through the process?
		1. 7 rounds in 7 days vs 4 months
			1. Someone who respond quicker are less concerned or have fewer issues
				1. If they are speeding through the process, money is not an issue
					1. Exceptions: Some may not have thought about the price
			2. Someone who is not quick - they might be slow rolling you
				1. They might be waiting and don't like what they hear and don't think they can pull it together
	6. They ask for extra estimates they don't use (red flag)
		1. In the total project, they don't get added
			1. Either non-essential or they cannot afford it
				1. They keep refusing until they get something within a certian cost - constrained by budget
	7. Give ballback estimates (exploratory tool)
		1. In an email, mention that the who thing will probably cost between 400 and 600 hours
			1. If they skip - not an issue
			2. If they stop - they probably don't have the budget

### Speed is important with clients ###
1. Speed: Responsiveness
	1. How long does it take you to respond
	2. What are you in the habit of doing with regards to response time
	3. Why is it important?
		1. TO close deals
		2. Keeps the client happy
			1. Avoids client anxiety
			2. Avoids client being upset
	4. Don't relax after closing a client
		1. Don't change the tone
		2. Clients might blow up because they have accumulated reasons that their needs are not being met
		3. Clients are anxious
			1. Why?
				1. They are
					1. Small business owners
						1. They migh lose their business
					2. Entrepreneurs
						1. They might lose their business and reputation
					3. Account managers
						1. People in charge of procurements in large companies
							1. They might lose their job
			2. Solution: **Constantly give them the feeling that you are always there**
				1. Don't give them time to worry
					1. Allows them to make false assumptions
				2. Slow response time gives an impression that something terrible is happening or ship is syncing
				3. Or they may assume that you don't know the answer to their question, or not integrated with the project, or not knowledgeable you said you are
					1. Erodes trust
					2. Erodes your ability to project yourself as authority
					3. A problematic relationship
				4. If someone asks you a question that requires research or collaboration, let then know you are there, and that you are aware that they need the information
					1. Give them a timeline
					2. Respond with a comprehensive answer
			3. Solution: **Check your phone often** (Tie yourself to phone)
				1. Helps you to manage clients
					1. Set keywords so that when client sends an email, you get notifications
				2. If you are going away for a certain period of time, let them know ahead of time
					1. At least set auto-responder
						1. Let them know that you are out of office or unavailable
							1. Especially on Saturdays and Sundays
				3. It's okay to lag during established times
				4. **Be consistent**
					1. Set it in the beginning of the relationship and maintain it

### Is the client always right? ###
1. Is the client always right?
	1. The client isn't always right
		1. If they were experts in development, they wouldn't have a reason to hire you
		2. Do you treat them they are right always?
			1. Companies have different strategies
				1. Everytime there's a complaint they treat the customer is always right - ensures customer is happy
					1. It is upto us
				2. If a client is unhappy 
					1. Companies give refund
					2. Companies give free hours if the cut corners
						1. To fix whatever the problem is
			2. Other extreme
				1. When they are presented with problems, it's always not their fault, it's always upto the client to lower their expectations
					1. This is not good
			3. Ideal - find balance
				1. Clients are not very technical (even technical ones)
				2. **Decide on a case by case basis**
					1. Don't have a standard across the board
						1. Too hard to make a general rule
			4. You can make a mistake
				1. Try to remedy the situation
					1. Even if you feel you will not see the client again
				2. Don't be overly apologetic
					1. Explain what went wrong
					2. Explain why the likelihood of it being wrong in the future is very very small
			5. Clients can be wrong
				1. Reasons
					1. Tried to make judgement themselves
					2. They assumed more than they actually do
				2. Solution: To make it easy to look back and check what went wrong
					1. Make sure you covered everything
						1. Detail out your process
						2. Make sure you have contract
							1. Ensure that you specify what you are covering in what timeframe for what
			6. Both sides can be wrong
				1. Figure out what went wrong - the following cases are our fault
					1. Did you simply build something wrong and we forgot to check it?
					2. Did you build something that you didn't explain properly?
					3. Is the timeline not sufficiently clear?
						1. Is client confused about when things will be delivered?
				2. Clients are wrong in the following cases
					1. Clients accusing you of not telling them something (when you clearly did and documents supporting it)
					2. Is the client surprised by a bill they received because they didn't pay attention when you gave them the estimate before
						1. If you properly documented everything, it is easy to figure out whose fault it is
							1. If it's not your fault, you can deal with it accordingly
							2. If it's your fault, admit your fault
								1. Own upto it and try to fix it
									1. Don't be too apologetic
			7. Breakdowns in communication are your fault
				1. As a service provider, provide everyting in excrucitating detail
				2. Ensure the client is on the same-page
				3. Ensure they understand exactly what's happening, when it's happening, and what to expect
				4. **There's never an excuse for not facilitating communication**
					1. It's your job
					2. It's the way to keep happy clients
					3. It's how you save yourself from issues down the road
				5. It always boils down to
					1. You didn't communicate
					2. You cut a corner
					3. You've not decided to send an update
					4. You decided to skip a step
				6. **Use it as a feedback opportunity to improve your process so that it doesn't happen in the future**

### Don't talk about problems, say what's happening ###
1. Just tell them what's happening
	1. Don't be ambiguous
		1. Vendors have setbacks, and not problems
			1. Setback: happens all the time
				1. The client should be aware of before they start the project
			2. Problem: The client has never seen before and they should be worried about
				1. It's a big deal
	2. **Problem: If something is broken and you don't know what it is**
		1. We don't want to give out the client the impression that it is a problem
	3. **Explain what's happening and how long it's going to take to get out of the snag**
		1. Say it can be solved
			1. Nothing is unsolvable 
		2. Don't be vague
			1. Don't use
				1. Broken
				2. Doesn't work
			2. Intead
				1. This does not do this and we can fix it

### Do you deliver what's good or what the client likes? ###
1. Do you follow your instincts, or do you follow your client?
	1. Some clients want things that won't look good
		1. It might be a poor outcome
	2. Evaluate your priorities
		1. Are you doing it for a portfolio?
			1. Don't use the project for your portfolio
				1. Convince them they're wrong
					1. Be explicit about what is wrong
					2. It is hard to explain
						1. Example: Color
				2. Consider walking away
					1. If it is purely for portfolio
					2. If in the middle of the project
						1. Wrap up quickly - don't waste resources
					3. If it is a big project or repeat client or lot of money
						1. Explain why it's bad
						2. At the end keep the client happy
						3. Minimize the damage
							1. Suggest alternatives (design)
							2. Suggest putting the section somewhere else
							3. Do some of the work free for them - to avoid damage to the project
				3. Clients with bad design and feature taste will probably have success in the future
					1. They might repeat it
					2. They might put the blame on you

### Section 9 Review Material ###

## Section 10: Best practices ##
### Under promise, over deliver ###
1. What is it?
	1. It is better to promise than what you are capable of and then over deliver
		1. Don't fail to meet expectations
		2. Keep clients happy
		3. Don't miss the mark
	2. Realistic expectations
		1. You want project to be built on realistic expectations
			1. How complicated
			2. How big
			3. How expensive
				1. Gives same priorities as you
		2. We want everybody on the same page
			1. No much miscommunication
			2. Don't have to try extra hard to impress the person
				1. Make it clear what they are looking for and what they are getting out of it
		3. Don't have to lie
		4. If we make a habit of promising more and delivering less, we will only be looking for new clients and not repeat clients
			1. Don't waste time looking for new clients
	3. This doesn't apply in the beginning
		1. It will not get you clients
			1. Portfolio is small
			2. Website doesn't look as good as final version
			3. Not many contacts
			4. Not many references
		2. Getting someone to sign a contract is hard if you are pessimistic about what you are going to do for them
2. Three things you can manipulate
	1. Cost
		1. **Should be manipulated - to get sales**
			1. Flip which ever way you need
		2. At the beginning
			1. Don't focus on how much money you are making per project
			2. **Be concerned about portfolio items and bringing in good long term clients you can show off to other people**
			3. See if you get price downward because you could be selected as the next vendor
				1. The target is to get **repeat clients**
			4. **You can overpromise on cost**
				1. Don't lose too much money
		3. Later on
			1. Don't compete for price unless it is a fantastic project that's great for many other reasons      
	2. Timeline
		1. Do not exaggerate on timeline
			1. Never works
			2. **Cannot fiddle with it**
				1. Don't pressure team to exceed the number of hours per week
					1. Project quality might go down
		2. If some other vendor is overpromising timeline, then it's a problem
	3. Expertise/Delivery
		1. Can we do this specific thing
		2. We may not be sure if we can do it in some cases
			1. If we can do one part but not the other, we may not get the project
				1. Solution: Give them flexibility
					1. Promise of adding new technology that you may not have at this moment
						1. How?
							1. You can say you can build for this platform
							2. If for the other platform you may not be able to build, say you are confident that you can do it and what's realistically going to happen if you do it
								1. Then say, you can lower the price for the project (cost) OR
								2. Then say, it might take another month to figure out (timeline)
		3. **Clients like recruiting one vendor for multiple technologies**

### What is agile? Should I use it? ###
1. Two ways to deliver a product
	1. Deliver it in one piece
		1. Feedback rounds later on 
	2. Deliver it in chunks
		1. Feedback after each round
		2. Estimate each task and feature
			1. Figure out how long each feature or task is going to take
		3. Sprint - burst of work
			1. We can tackle with each chunk of work
			2. **Each chunk is fully tested and deployable**
				1. It is a finished chunk
			3. Each chunk should not have any dependencies on other sections
				1. **Each chunk should deploy as if it is 100% done**
	3. Development team works with designer in tandem and as the designer designs, developers develop
		2. Advantages:
			1. Design is flexible
			2. They can change things as the requirements change
2. Benefits:
	1. faster
	2. Code that is better produced and better tested
	3. Re-assess project mid-progression and make any changes along the way you need to
	4. More flexible and modular way of looking at a project
	5. Easier to sell
		1. Estimation can be in an agile way - in hours
			1. More transparent
			2. More digestable
		2. Hourly estimates can be applied for each task
			1. Helps them visualize how big their project is and how big certain sections are
			2. Helps them pick and drop sections they want and don't
	6. We can periodically deliver 100% deployable code
		1. Allows client to play with it
	7. Clients see the progress
		1. After each iteration
	8. Each chunk can be estimated to cost so much
	9. We can say we will be Charging only for the first chunk
		1. If you are not happy in any way, we can take the code and integrate it with a different firm or different contractor
		2. Helps client decide whether to continue or get out of the project early
	10. Helps figure out earlier if something's wrong
		1. Whether to make a pivot or make some changes
	11. Avoids making hard project decisions later on
3. Should you use agile?
	1. Easier to sell
	2. More interactive
	3. More transparent
4. How to integrate?
	1. Build out and deliver individual features
	2. Follow basic agile systems
	3. Pick contractors who know Agile
		1. Let them know this is how you want to deliver the project
		2. This how they should be doing their estimates
		3. This is how they should be timing their updates and their checkins
	4. Clients don't care if you use Scrum or XP

### Client budgets and what difference they make ###
1. Why is it important?
	1. Whether I can make margin on it
	2. Whether I can make very easily or do very well
2. Work with clients that have good budgets
	1. New businesses work with clients that have budgets all over the place
		1. They might work with clients that have budgets that don't fit their project needs
	2. More established companies work with clients that:
		1. Have been around for a while
		2. Are used to paying what they should be paying for the project
		3. Have the longevity to stick around to see projects succeed
		4. Can re-invest and have war chest to draw from
3. **We want to work with the cream of the crop**
	1. Healthier or proportionate budgets are important
		1. **Bigget budgets, better projects**
			1. It can pay for better graphic design
			2. It can pay for research and come up with solutions to novel problems
			3. It can pay for when things break
			4. It can pay for additional features
			5. It can pay for complete pivot away from the original concept or idea they found out to be more successful
4. A dead project is only as valuable to you as the $ amount you pocketed from it
5. **A successful project is a fantastic portfolio item**
	1. It can constantly give you leads
	2. It can constantly be used to show off you work
	3. It's a shining star in the portfolio
6. A dead project is hard to show
	1. Cannot be referenced
	2. It is a dead end
7. **You want to be building your business around momentum**
	1. Do projects that help you now and help you land your next project
		1. You want it to be a snowball effort
			1. **Start projects that can get better projects in the future**
	2. A project that fails doesn't help you improve in the future
8. **Focus on budget**
	1. A bad project is because you are hamstrung by the amount of money and time you could spend on it
		1. Project could have been successful if the client had the budget to push through other iterations of the idea
9. Try to focus on the ones that are realistic based on the money that they have and how to apply that towards making their projects sucessful
10. Don't focus on clients that have just enough money to make it work
	1. They have a high likelyhood of failure
	2. It doesn't help you
11. **Bigger budgets, better project, better portfolio, better success rate, ...**
	1. Good firms focus on client success and project success beyond the scope of development

### Web presence clients aren't worth it ###
1. Look for clients that have depth
	1. **That have projects that are ambitious and have development depth to them**
		1. When starting business - once-off clients are okay (web-presense clients)
			1. Web-presense client
				1. They just want to get a website or mobile presense application
					1. Just display info on who they are and what their company does and announce upcoming products ...
					2. "Hello internet" guys
				2. Problems:
					1. Design is more expensive than development usually
						1. Such projects are not development deep    
							1. Very easy to put on platforms
								1. Wordpress
								2. Squarespace
								3. Wix
						2. They don't look for adding complexity
							1. No new ideas
							2. No custom specs or algos or features
						3. They look for flat pages with basic functionality
					2. It's hard to compete with companies that are spending millions of dollars to build a platform for them
					3. They are usually clients with less budget
						1. After the project is done, they have nothing else for us to do
							1. We get into a cycle of constantly looking for clients
					4. They don't have repeat work
2. **Focus on projects that can expand**
	1. Applications
3. **Focus on novelty**
4. **Web-presence clients are great for portfolio**
	1. Cannot grow with this type of clients

### Price per project, price per hour ###
1. Two types
	1. Price per hour
		1. Time and materials
		2. Estimate how many hours it will take
			1. Work on the project and bill afterwards
		3. Well established firms charge time and materials and don't give estimation
			1. They charge per hour rate
			2. They charge only after the project is done
			3. They use net15 or net30 to get paid
		4. Preferred
			1. Reasons:
				1. Estimations are not always correct
					1. It is not possible to get estimate accurately all the time
					2. Why?
						1. It is not practical to know everything that goes on in a project
						2. It needs enormous amount of time upfront to figure how complex each individual issue included in a project is
							1. We might estimate 10 hours but we might actually run into issues and take 30 hours
				2. Easier communication
					1. We can say how long it took you
						1. You are paid for your time
		5. Cons:
			1. It is harder to be competitive with time and material
				1. We cannot bid against other people
				2. It is hard to change per hour rate
					1. It becomes hard to believe you when you say a developer is $30 / hour when in the beginnnig we said $50 / hour
			2. Clients don't like it
				1. They cannot budget upfront (which they like to do)
					1. They want to know how much it is going to cost
					2. They want to know if anything goes wrong it falls on us to figure it out and keep it within budget
				2. Anxiety
					1. What if we thought it was 100 hours but ended up to be a 1000 hours
						1. Breaks org budget
						2. They may not realize that it is going beyond budget on time
	2. Price per project
		1. Take a chunk for work and give estimate for the entirely of task
			1. Regardless of how long the task taskes
			2. We give the price at the beginning and clients agree with us
			3. We might get paid at the end or split up into milestones
		2. Cons:
			1. Disadvantage for development firm: We need to bid upfront what we think it is
				1. Solution:
					1. If we are smart, we can hedge and say this is what I think it will be but with more research and more information, it might change.
					2. This is the range it will be. Once I spend time on it, I can get more specific
			2. Estimation takes time
				1. We could spend a lot of time estimating upfront
					1. 2-3 hours per project
					2. If we estimate multiple projects, we don't know which ones we are going to win
					3. We will end up wasting time 
		3. Pros:
			1. Competitive
				1. We can lower the price to bid out other people
				2. If we have a specialty that we know we are good at as compared to other people, it has an advantage because it might take 1/2 the time it takes someone else
					1. Expertise
					2. Ready to use code-base
					3. Projects from which we can take pieces
		4. Agile:
			1. **We estimate a price per chunk of work**
				1. A hybrid
				2. Bidding per hour and giving hourly estimate
				3. We will cover it if it goes above this amount
		5. **When we start - At first, we'll use price per project**
			1. Scheme used by Frealancers or devlelopment firms first
				1. When we don't have ready client base that comes again and again
					1. We may just give them what they want
						1. Especially for new client (unless they came from a warm referral)
	3. Others (not so important)
		1. Day rates
		2. Hybrid rates
2. Guidlines:
	1. We will be doing a mix of both
	2. In the beginning we might be doing more of price per project
		1. **Best price for best project**

### Should you worry about competition? ###
1. No!
	1. Why
		1. Almost indefinite amount of development work
			1. Constantly being produced and needed
	2. Why do clients pick development firms?
		1. They can match their expertise.
		2. They have a good reputation.
		3. They have a good portfolio.
		4. They can build a relationship to them.
2. Problems:
	1. Highly fragmented market
		1. It is impossible for one company to compare to another on an apple's to apple's ratio
			1. If a client has a proposal and a timeline,
				1. How does he know if there is a better proposal from a better company?
					1. Market lacks transparency because every development firm is different
					2. Every single client and what they need is also very different
					3. There are always different configurations in terms of what you can offer as a development firm and indefinite number of configurations that clients need
						1. **Clients care about referrals and their relationship with the contractor**
		2. There is no single company that can dominate the market and steal from everyone
		3. Indefinite opportunties
			1. Many technologies
			2. Many projects
3. **Don't worry about competition**
	1. Don't try to find out - there are too many
4. The only reason we look at competition
	1. To emulate what they are doing
		1. You can learn from competitors
			1. Ideas about how to improve your service
			2. Ideas for areas to move into
			3. Techniques
			4. Best practices
5. **Your abilities are what matter**
	1. To find clients
	2. To keep good relationships
	3. To keep good business fundamentals

### Hedging your launch date ###
1. The project timeline (car trip from A to B)
	1. There could be landmines (0 - 100)
		1. We canot calculate how many landmines there could be
			1. People could get sick
			2. External services might be taken down
			3. Other vendors (assets from designer, say) could be late
	2. Solution: Hedge your launch date
		1. You might say: I will deliver it the first week of July (instead of July 1st)
			1. People don't care about a single day it will be delivered
				1. Clients who are strict about timelines are unrealistic and hard to work with
		2. **Plan on hitting a couple "landmines"** (any issue that could blow up take coule days)
		3. **Set a range of dates for launch**
	3. Deadlines in Development projects are rarely set
		1. Only set if disproportionate amount of time is taken
	4. **Internally plan to launch on July 1st** (significant breathing room)
	5. If they ask why?
		1. Say some potential issues could arise

### Beautiful design makes beautiful development ###
1. Good development, bad design
	1. It cannot be shown off
		1. Not trend-setting
2. If designer is not good quality, it looks the product look bad
	1. Customers only see the design (they see the visual layer first)
		1. The most experienced ones pay attention to the backend interaction
	2. Ugly UI is ugly to everyone
		1. Ugly code is only ugly to developer
3. Great design makes a great portfolio
	1. Consider who is the designer to take the decision to work with the client
		1. Look at where the design is coming from and see if you can request it upfront
			1. It is a factor to consider when deciding whether to work with the client
				1. **Ask to see their work**
	2. **Keep a list of designers** (we worked with or ones who make good, reasonably priced design)
		1. We are usually contracted after conception stage and usually after design phase
			1. Clients introduce the designer to you
		2. Clients may not be happy with their design or they simply don't have the design
			1. **If we know somebody who can give a high quality design we can work on the project that could actually be shown off**
		3. **Offer to design it yourself**
			1. Find your own designers
				1. Try to work with them in a couple of projects
				2. We can find somebody who we can work with for a prolonged period of time
					1. We may not even make margins on their rates
						1. Reasons: 
							1. Whatever they design will be the face of anything you develop
								1. If they are really good, we are benefitting from their work
		4. Great designers are worth working with
			1. Even if the application is clunky
				1. It is going to look good - 99% people might percieve it to be good
4. **You can't show off bad design**
5. **Great design changes everything**
6. **Know more about your designer**
	1. Decide the client based on designer
	2. Can introduce the designer
	3. Get your own designer

### Running without contracts ###
1. Working without signing a contract
	1. Reasons why you work without a contract
		1. Work is incredibly small
		2. Past client who we trust
		3. Friend or family
			1. Could come out rude
		4. We might think a contract might scare them away - extra step
2. **Always sign a contract**
	1. Make contracts easy and sign quickly
		1. Don't do damage control later
3. Things to keep in mind
	1. Don't do this with someone who has never paid you before
		1. Collaboration is not considered working with them for money
		2. We can know them only if we establish a cash relationship with them
		3. If we can pay each other, chances of having misommunication is slimmer
		4. People's behavior when money is involved is very different
	2. Keep a paper trail as much as possible
		1. Try to force all communication to something that has a record
			1. Email - extensive
			2. Screenshots of updates
			3. Screenshots of changes to application (annotations)
			4. As much paper as you can
				1. Avoid blame game
	3. Make sure to include costs and features (in every opportunity)
		1. Always list out everything you are doing
		2. Ensure you record your client seeing, you saying it costs this, and them agreeing to it
		3. Written records will save you
4. Verbal agreement 
	1. If we have records of conversations
		1. Signature is not explicit
	2. It could be ambiguous
5. The minimum contract
	1. That you are hired for them
	2. The work you would do
	3. Anything extra is addendum
6. Online platforms have contracts (Elance, Upwork, ...)

### Red flags for bad clients ###
1. Whether a client is going to be a nightmare
2. Good clients
	1. We learn from them
	2. Easy to work with
	3. They have the right budget
	4. They respond on time
	5. They are forgiving when anything happens
	6. They understand somethings are out of control
3. Difficult clients
	1. Lot of expectation issues
	2. Authority issues
	3. Immature
	4. Unprofessional
	5. Trust issues
	6. Takes too much time to get anything done
3. Common scenarios 
	1. They disagree with your estimates
		1. Very complicated and technical and customized - We cannot know exactly what it is going to take
		2. It is a big red flag
			1. Non-technical clients disagreeing is worse
		3. UI design takes time
			1. Clients might disagree - just get rid of them
	2. Their project idea makes no sense
		1. You don't have to be a picker of winner (your are not VC, or Angel Investor, ...)
		2. You should have a decent idea of whether the idea is terrible or okay
			1. If it doesn't make sense
				1. Example: It is derivative of something else
			2. Any disconnect - red flag
		3. If they have bad ideas - problem with client
	3. They try to haggle with your rates
		1. If they say I will pay only $15 per hour when you are pitching $50 an hour - they are haggling with you
			1. If they say I can afford only $25 per hour - that indicates that they don't have the budget
		2. If they say it is not worth it - they are haggling
		3. Let them go - they have no experience and not professional
			1. Why would your team work for lower price?
			2. Don't let them underpay you
		4. People may not have the budget
	4. They give you multiple proposals at once
		1. Scatterbrain client
			1. Each project needs thinking and understanding
			2. They may not be committed and are not focussed
		2. Work with clients who are serious about their project
	5. They argue over trivial items
		1. Example:
			1. Font-sizing
			2. Text in contract
			3. Prjects internally and how we spell them
		2. People who don't know to prioritize and only try to prove themselves in some way
			1. They are insecure and immature
		3. They probably don't have a track record of success
			1. Successful people don't nit-pick things that simply don't matter
		4. The person will drive you crazy
			1. You don't want to work with them
	6. They are unprofessional
		1. People who throw tantrums
		2. They might say things they shouldn't
		3. They might lie blatently
		4. They miss phone-calls you scheduled
		5. They might not have been successful with anything they have done
		6. Their project might be dead in the end

### Rich clients versus successful clients ###
1. Rich vs Successful
	1. Rich
		1. We do a disservice
		2. They just have lots of funds
			1. We don't know how they got the money
				1. Did they inherit?
				2. What did they do to produce the funds?
		3. What they did in the past might be irrelevant to what they are doing now
		4. They might be enjoyable clients to work with
			1. They may not grow your business
			2. Large projects may not have a good life-expectency
				1. **It is good to work on medium projects that goes on for years than a large project that fails out of the gate**
	2. Successful
		1. **Pick successful clients**
			1. They need to have a track record of success
				1. **They have a portfolio of their own**
				2. They consistently pick ideas that have potential
		2. Successful clients launch something that brings you business consistently for a very long period of time
		3. They are going to refer you to similar people
			1. These people are going to launch similar ventures and may be similarly successful
		4. **Look their portfolio to know**
			1. How successful the client has been in the past
				1. Are they doing well?
				2. Are they getting customers?
				3. Are they getting seen?
			2. If people see them in your portfolio and recognize, it's a huge plus
				1. **Increases the value of your portfolio**
2. **Vet your clients as they vet you**

### Tell when you're getting fizzled ###
1. Efficiency saving techniques
2. Getting "fizzled"
	1. Client is not interested in the project proposal you have given them and are slowly getting disconnected and backing away
	2. We should be able to tell
		1. Don't waste your time with someone who is fizzling you
	3. Reasons:
		1. They don't have money
		2. They are not serious about completing the project
			1. Not confident about the idea (due to complexity)
		3. They might feel it's over their head
		4. They might be looking at other offers
			1. Other vendors might have hit the mark better than you did
	4. Cut your losses
		1. Things to look for
			1. Pyramid conversations
				1. Large conversations at the beginning but thins out to small conversations later on
					1. Info given to you gets smaller and smaller...
				2. He has lost enthusiasm in you
					1. They are slowly backing off
				3. They might use your estimates to anchor it with other vendor they are going for
			2. Slower and slower response times
				1. Client initially responds within an hour
				2. Over time it increases
				3. To couple weeks
				4. Client is backing off
				5. If you are asking simple questions, and they take a long time to respond, they are not serious about you
			3. Asking the same questions
				1. If they are talking to other people, they might have forgotten that they asked you the same question before
				2. The answer is not sticking with them or unconfident of the answer and in you
			4. Using vague timelines
				1. Referring to decisions
					1. In a couple of months we are going to make a decision
					2. They might refer it back to other people
						1. Just offloading the guilt of not picking you
				2. If there were serious, they would be definite about the timelines
				3. Vague: We will do it in Q2, ...
					1. If there were interested, they will typically give you a month or a hard deadline with different milestones

### Don't quote off the top of your head ###
1. They might ask you on the spot how many hours it's going to be
	1. Don't give estimates on the spot
		1. Never do it - even if you are experienced
			1. Reasons:
				1. The real estimate can be different
					1. You might have missed something for the original estimate
					2. The client forgot to mention something
					3. If the real estimate is not within the range you mentioned, you might lose the contract
						1. They don't trust you
							1. You don't want to lose your authority and position as an expert
		2. Development firms don't usually do this
			1. It is industry standard
	2. Get back to them with the estimate (in a short amount of time)
		1. Use a framework to establish a ballpark estimate
			1. Best case:
				1. Making them slightly happy with you
			2. Worst case:
				1. Block them from coming back
	3. If we really need to give estimate immediately
		1. Give one end of the range
			1. Over a 1000 hours
			2. Under 2000 hours
			3. Under 1600 hours
		2. If we miss a little, we can adjust the price

### Meeting in person ###
1. If we are using contractors
	1. We can run the business without meeting their client
		1. We are used to working with clients remotely
		2. Unless it is a multi-million dollar project and for reason they needed that
2. Reasons to meet 
	1. To close a potential sale
		1. Client wants to see you what you are like
		2. Client wants to see how quick on your feet you are
		3. Client wants to see in person what you did in your projects in the past
		4. Client wants to see your portfolio and your approach to their project
	2. Client has a culture of meeting in person
		1. It's a hassle to change everything to work exclusively with you through skype or email
		2. Occassionally they want you to be there when you deploy or when something goes wrong or basic checkins
3. Meet clients if you can
	1. Helps establish bond between you and them
		1. Personal level connection
	2. It gives more confidence to them
4. Success comes with preparedness, composure, and confidence
	1. Preparedness: How well we can anticipate what they want and what the context of the meeting is
	2. Composure: To with your personality in general and your experience in meetings like this
		1. Comes with experience
		2. Willing to fail
	3. Confidence: Whether you are confident you can answer their questions. How technical you are, or how proud of your portfolio you feel like

		2. They want experts in making awesome products
			1. You can make suggestions at appropriate times

	2. If it's a small contract then re-consider
		1. Calculate the loss in terms of time

### Is there a benefit to delivering early? ###
1. Giving a lax timeline but delivering early
	1. It might give the wrong impression
		1. There are no real benefits
			1. If we are early, then spend more time internally, do more testing, do more deep dive, try to fix more bugs (could be cosmetic), and deliver on the deadline promised.
	2. Giving early does not give them any benefit
		1. Maybe they didn't plan for it and it might just be sitting there for a few days
		2. It might just appear that you are a good vendor and nothing more
	3. A few days don't matter
	4. If you save them money, or gave them an extra feature, ... that is more important
	5. It doesn't matter to them
	6. If you have over estimated, then spend more time on improving the project
		1. Bug testing
			1. It could have a wow effect
		2. Breathing room helps perfect the project

### Repeat customers are the best ###
1. Why are repeat customers important?
	1. New clients vs Repeat clients
		1. Getting new clients tke time and efforts
			1. Time spent is not re-imbursed
				1. Running ad campaigns
				2. Reaching out to people
				3. Talking to people and answering their questions
				4. Estimating their projects
				5. Negotiating contracts
				6. Getting them to sign contracts
				7. Following up with them
				8. Starting the project
			2. For a 100 hour project, you might spend 10 hours upfront to get the client
				1. You might have spent another 4-5 hours chasing projects you didn't get
				2. Cumulatively, you might have spent 50 hours for a 100 hour project
		2. Repeat clients
			1. The likelyhood of getting the project is very high
			2. More focus on development
			3. You're doing something well
				1. If they are coming back to you, they are satisfied with your service
			4. They are the best referrals
2. To grow your business:
	1. **Focus on momentum**
		1. Finding new clients is a momentum killer
			1. Example: Only work off referrals - work into network - no looking for clients
				1. No wasting time on things that don't pay you
					1. Competitive rates
					2. Better that what you do
					3. More margin to spend in other places
	2. **Focus on things that give the best ROI for your time**
		1. Things that give best referrals
			1. Helps with momentum
			2. Allows growing the business

### Avoid assumers ###
1. Worst possible clients
	1. The assumers
		1. Who are "the assumers"?
			1. They are not used to specificity required to run a successful development business
				1. They think it is okay to speak in vague terms and make generalized comparisons that are very unspecific and unhelpful
					1. They use **imprecise language** to describe something to you
				2. Your job is to breakdown that information into something specific and precise and actually describes a real application
			2. **They assume you know what they need**
				1. They refer to an example and say build it like this
				2. Once you build it, they say no, I thought you understood and I need this, this, and this
				3. They use vague terms like **like facebook**, **like this feature**, ...
					1. They are not precise
			3. They use "loaded" sentences
				1. They describe things that sound simple but there are a lot of things hidden underneath the sentence that when we try to develop it, we could struggle
			4. Solution:
				1. Always ask for more details
					1. Break the rock down and get them agree to individual pieces
						1. Give them options to get the specifics out of them
							1. **Don't agree to something vague**
								1. Don't work for 100s of hours on a project that is described in a paragraph
			5. Avoid assumers
				1. They are vague
				2. They pack too many features into each sentence
