## What is the difference between product management and project management in the context of software development? ##

In the context of **software development**, **product management** and **project management** serve distinct but complementary roles:  

### **1. Product Management** (Focus on "What & Why")  
- **Goal:** Defines the **vision, strategy, and roadmap** for a software product.  
- **Key Responsibilities:**  
  - Identifying market needs and user problems.  
  - Defining product features and priorities based on business goals.  
  - Collaborating with stakeholders (customers, engineers, designers, marketing).  
  - Managing the **product lifecycle** (from ideation to launch and iteration).  
  - Ensuring the product delivers value and achieves business objectives.  
- **Key Deliverables:** Product roadmap, feature backlog, market research insights.  
- **Key Metrics:** User engagement, retention, revenue, customer satisfaction.  

### **2. Project Management** (Focus on "How & When")  
- **Goal:** Ensures the **successful execution** of a project within time, scope, and budget constraints.  
- **Key Responsibilities:**  
  - Planning and coordinating development efforts.  
  - Managing timelines, resources, and dependencies.  
  - Monitoring progress and resolving bottlenecks.  
  - Risk management and stakeholder communication.  
  - Ensuring deliverables align with product and business goals.  
- **Key Deliverables:** Project plan, timelines, status reports, risk assessments.  
- **Key Metrics:** On-time delivery, budget adherence, project efficiency.  

### **Key Differences**  
| Aspect            | Product Management | Project Management |
|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Focus**       | What to build & why | How to build & deliver it |
| **Main Goal**   | Define product vision & strategy | Execute projects efficiently |
| **Success Metric** | Product-market fit, revenue, adoption | On-time, on-budget, within scope delivery |
| **Timeframe**   | Continuous (lifecycle of the product) | Temporary (until project completion) |
| **Works With**  | Customers, executives, marketing, sales, dev team | Developers, designers, stakeholders, product managers |

### **How They Work Together**  
A **Product Manager** defines **what** should be built and why, while a **Project Manager** ensures it gets built efficiently and on time.
