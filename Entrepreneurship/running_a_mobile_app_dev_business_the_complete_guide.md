### 7 reasons to start a mobile app development business ###
1. Reason #1
	1. Everybody needs or wants a mobile app
		1. Every company has a mobile strategy
		2. If they have not built it, they are actively looking to build it
		3. Most don't hire their own team, designer, or developer to put together an in-house mobile app 
			1. They are looking for freelancers and companies that specialze in mobile apps
		4. It's the easiest sell in the world
			1. Everyone needs one and want to eventually get one

### iOS versus Android ###
1. iOS and Android - 97% of market
2. How to pick between iOS and Android
	1. Clients prefer iOS (9:1)
		1. They choose the platforms that put them in the best position to make money and look good
		2. Reasons:
			1. Demographics
				1. US, Europe, developed countries
				2. iOS users have more money
					1. Middle income or upper middle income bracket
						1. They have disposable income
			2. Branding
				1. If companies want to control how users feel when they use their application, and control user experience, are going to pick a platform that they can control
					1. iOS - 20 screen sizes
						1. To give a consistent experience we pick this because it is less fragmented
							1. You don't want anything to look off and you want to them to fit seemlessly
					2. Android - 200+ screen sizes
						1. People usually build for 5-6 main screen resolutions and hope that it fits for the rest of them
			3. How your app is presented
				1. iOS: AppStore
					1. It is centralized
						1. The only place to get it
						2. Standardized 
						3. Easy to understand
					2. **I would go for something that looks better and is standardized**
					3. **Ranking is also in one place**
				2. Android:
					1. Google playstore
						1. The ranking may not be consistent across stores
					2. Amazon app store
					3. Other websites
						1. I don't know how it is going to look like in the third party sites
			4. A user on iOS is more valuable
				1. They are more willing to spend money and are willing to spend money more often
				2. Advertising on iOS gets a better rate
					1. Android - 1/10th maybe
				3. Worth 60% more than Android user
					1. The platform makes more money
			5. Most companeis start with iOS
				1. They follow the lead of the other companies
					1. Odd the otherway around
3. You as a mobile app business
	1. Focus on iOS
		1. Secondary expertise in Android
	2. Why iOS makes more money?
		1. Usually people want both
		2. iOS only is common
		3. Dual applications: more money
			1. Be there first
	3. A brand to protect: more money
		1. They are well established
		2. It is easier to explain to them why should they add more to the application and make it better to make the user feel better
		3. If they don't care how it looks or feels, they probably are not a well established company with a large budget
		4. Android:
			1. Too many screen resolutions
				1. We might have to focus on a section of popular ones
					1. We might have visual errors in other devices
			2. Visual errors
			3. Slower adoption of updates
				1. iOS updates their OS quite frequently
					1. People download very quickly
				2. Android - Harder to know what you are going to develop for
					1. The OS versions might be different on different phones
			4. Benefits of Android
				1. Open OS
					1. We can modify more of their system and access more of their features than iOS
						1. If someone asks for a feature for iOS which doesn't support it, we can do it for Android
				2. 8 times more users
					1. If we care about how many people could see our application, it could be important
				3. Dominant in developing economies
					1. If we have a strategy to get the app to outside developed countries, we have to go Android
		5. iOS is rarely excluded
			1. Company could exclude Android
4. **Tip: Focus on iOS and have a separate sub-contracting strategy for Android**

### Native versus hybrid ###
1. Native application:
	1. Designed for one specific platform
	2. Written in programming language specific to the platform
	3. Takes more time, more money
		1. Requires a specific unique custom skillset
		2. Uses specific tools for different platforms
			1. Apple: Tools + SDK kits
			2. Android: Tools + SDK kits
	4. User Experience
		1. Better
			1. Access phone features
				1. Dialing numbers
				2. Sending SMS
				3. Saving photos
				4. Taking photos
			3. Looks better
				1. They fit the screen perfectly
				2. Graphics made for the screen resolution
			4. Flows better
				1. Responds faster
			5. Controls a lot of different things
2. Hybrid application:
	1. It can be deployed on every platform
	2. They use common programming languages similar to web programming languages
	3. Example:
		1. Adobe AIR
		2. PhoneGap
			1. Web programming languages
	4. Faster and cheaper
		1. It uses web technologies
		2. You only have to make one version and customize it
	5. User Experience
		1. Not so good
			1. Hard to control hardware
				1. They are not built for a specific phone or platform
					1. Since they are generic
3. Mobile websites
	1. Websites that display on your phone correctly
4. Which strategy to use?
	1. Digital studio - go with native
		1. Reasons:
			1. UX is better
				1. You don't want to run into problems with hybrid apps down the road
				2. It is much easier to have a beautiful design in a native application
		2. Push-back for hybrid applications
			1. Most applications they are used to or make references to are going to be native
		3. Helps make more money or get good deals
		4. Build for iOS first and then build for Android later (if required)
5. When to choose hybrid?
	1. Criteria for using hybrid
		1. The app doesn't need to access phone hardware
		2. Client simply wants "presence" through a mobile app
			1. It is just an extension of the web
			2. They don't need anything specific that a mobile app needs to do that a web-app can't do
		3. The client is budget conscious
			1. Save 60% of project cost but the application is going to be not as good - budget conscious clients may say yes

### Build yourself or contract? ###
1. Non-programmers skip this
2. Programmers
	1. You know your abilities
	2. Don't program 100% of the time
		1. To maintain higher quality of time
			1. Not efficient
			2. Who will bring new project?
		2. Contracts
			1. A burst of work
			2. Mainenance
			3. Add ons - small work 
		3. You also have to do marketing and sales
			1. 30% of time
			2. Can you be a lead developer spending only 70% of the time?
	3. Why programmers have an advantages?
		1. They can take better project decisions during a project
	4. What you bring to the business may not be your programming skill
		1. Their best contribution is oversight
			1. Insert brilliance to a contractor and to management + basic project oversight
				1. **Low cost contractors + High quality product**
					1. **Focus on low-cost**
				2. If we add premium quality contractors we can even enhance the quality to extra-premium quality products
		2. Think about how use your time
			1. If we are programming all day, we cannot benefit from the collaboration

### In-house hiring or out of house? ###
1. Most dev companies have in-house staff
	1. It was not worth employing
2. In-house disadvantages:
	1. It's harder to take on a variety of projects
		1. Contracted - we can let go and hire
		2. Employees - stuck to their skill-set
			1. Gets paid even if he doesn't work on a project
	2. It takes time and a lot of paperwork
		1. Hoops to go through
		2. Takes long to integrate into team
			1. Difficult to ramp-up on projects
				1. If we are doing well or if clients are doing well, it will be difficult to ramp up to meet their new demand
	3. Recruiting is difficult and expensive
		1. So much competition
			1. We end up high premium
	4. It's difficult to fire them

	3. They don't cut corners, they are more involved
		1. Contractors are only concerned about whether they get paid
			1. They don't care about the finished product, but only about billable hours and the sections they are assigned
			2. There are exceptions
4. Big companies usually care more about quality
	1. They work with people who don't think about budget
	2. If product offering is different than that, consider contracting
	3. Product quality doesn't require employees
		1. In many cases, you need a combination
			1. Contractors are flexible
5. Flexibility vs Ability
	1. In-house teams - advantage in ability
	2. Contracting firms - flexibility
		1. If a contractor doesn't have a project to work on, they have their own product load
6. Full-time vs part-time and Cash vs Reputation (building a brand and establishing reputation)
	1. Cash (care about this) + Part-time: Contractors
	2. Reputation (a lot of publicity) + Full-Time: Employees
7. Find the perfect fit for you
	1. Depends on what you want and what you are capable of

### In country or out of country? ###

	2. Less budget, more effort
		1. Watch developer more closely and check in more often
	3. If they cannot do what you say because of language barrier or communication barrier, if gaps in technological knowledge, it causes issues
		1. Technical business owner can handle it better
			1. Outsourcing is more beneficial - price-parity advantage
				1. If lot of skill + less money - outsource
	4. If both, look for best relationships

## Section 3: Setting up your presence ##
### Focus on 80/20 solutions for your online presence ###
1. Web presence tips
	1. The importance of your web presence
		1. When a client or professional client looks at your proposal, they are going to judge through the lense of your website
			1. If it is a well-polished website, the end product is going to look similar to that
				1. If it looks bad, they might think the opposite
			2. They also are likely to believe you if you tell them a price
			3. They also are likely to believe you if you give them suggestions to change something
	2. Don't spend all your resources upfront
		1. For lean startup
		2. Why?
			1. Sites are expensive
		3. The 80/20 rule
			1. You can get 80% of the effect of having a good website with 20% of the effort
				1. To get the rest of the 20%, we might need to spend 80% effort
		4. At the beginning, we don't know what the messaging is
			1. We don't know what ideas, concepts, words resonate with the target market
		5. We don't know how the portfolio is going to look like or display it, or what your specialization is going to be
		6. Solution: Start simple and improve over time
			1. Use templates - cheap and easy
				1. They look awesome & cost almost nothing
					1. Drawback - no much control on customization
				2. In the beginning, we must get something out there
					1. Later we can start investing in web-presence to improve it
				3. **It takes a lot of money to get a design that is slightly better than what you can do with a template**
					1. When you have more resources, then focus on improving it
						1. Improve them as you get more feedback

## Section 9: Best Practices ##
### Should you submit the app for your client? ###
1. Submission takes time
	1. Time is not development time
		1. We don't know if we are going to bill for or going to get paid for
	2. Two ways of handling submission
		1. Handle all submissions for them
			1. Benefit
				1. **Offer it as an amenity**
					1. Clients like it
					2. Say: We cover all the way until it hits the app-store and gets real users
				2. Why?
					1. 2-17 days - usable time
						1. We are behind on several tasks or features
							1. Helps us get time to fix bugs, finishing tasks, and polishing the app
						2. We can finish version 1.1 by the time 1.0 gets approved
							1. Next version is much quicker to get approval
					2. Showing interest in client's success
						1. Shows that we are with you for the entire project and not just the scope we are hired for
							1. Clients like it
		2. Tell client that it is up to them to submit it to the app store or Google play store
			1. Option 1: Letting the client submit the app
				1. Apple is notorious for wait times when we submit our application
					1. The studio could be blamed for it
						1. 2 days to 2.5 weeks
							1. Studios want to avoid being blamed
				2. Billable hours:
					1. Hard to get billable hours for the time it takes to submit it
					2. Hard to calculate the time it takes to submit an app, wait for it, review it, submit new versions
					3. Hard to schedule sub-contractors or employees
						1. They are not completely free to work on something else
	3. How to make the client stop blaming you for the delay
		1. Tell the client
			1. Two options
				1. App submission
					1. This is generally chosen by clients
				2. Submit yourself
					1. Explain the details
						1. Answer these questions
						2. Go through this documentation
						3. It is going to take this long
							1. It might take a week to two weeks for you to do it
	4. Can you bill for this time?
		1. We can bill for it
			1. Setup time
				1. Things not directly related to the development time
			2. Be transparent and separate it - Bill for it separate
				1. Don't overestimate it
					1. It doesn't take much time
						1. 3-4 billable hours - negligible for large projects
