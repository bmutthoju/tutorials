### Crash course terminology ###
1. Terms and terminology
	1. User Interface (UI)
		1. Buttons, graphics, text, ... (what we can see, click, scroll through, ...(
		2. It's whatever we interact with (not background services)
	2. User Experience
		1. UI + a lot more
		2. Includes
			1. Graphics
			2. Interactivity
			3. User flow 
		3. **It covers everything a user experiences when interacting with your website or mobile app**
		4. When user hits a page, they have a goal, they have to complete tasks to get to that point
			1. The process is called UX
		5. UX expert - Gets a user from point A to point B without frustrating them and getting the information they need
			1. Understands how users and consumers get confused in and what areas they can complete well
		6. Also includes graphic design
	3. Interactivity
		1. Things that move, we click, ... with actual functions
		2. Things that user interacts with on the website, and not just plainly browse it
		3. It's an extension of a design
		4. Interactivity - all possible interactions on a website
	4. Site Map
		1. Visual representation of all the pages on your website or mobile app and the rough relationship between them
		2. Hierarchy tree
		3. They don't include backend functions
	5. Storyboard
		1. Visual representation of how an animation or a movie shooting scene progresses from beginnnig to end
		2. Not about websites
	6. Persona
		1. A type of common user
		2. An archetype of a common user
		3. Traits
			1. How old is the user?
			2. What are they trying to get out of your website?
			3. How did they hear about your website?
			4. How familiar are they with technology?
			5. ...
		4. Example:
			1. Business courses in Udemy
				1. 25-35
				2. Work in a technology company
				3. Came to find a course for excel
			2. There are tools to make you understand how users will potentially interact with your website
			3. What are the pitfalls based on their needs
	7. Information Architecture
		1. How is information and content displayed on your website
		2. Someone decided
			1. Where the logo goes
			2. Where the headline goes
			3. Where the tagline goes
			4. How long should the headline be
			5. Description text
			6. What colors should that be placed in
			7. How important is it to be on the front-page vs the second page
		3. **It is the organization of information and how to best set it up so that users can efficiently and effectively digest the information**
	8. Responsive Design
		1. Layout is responsive to other screen sizes
		2. Confirms to smaller screens

### What is a wireframe? What is a prototype? ###
1. What are wireframes (skeleton)
	1. A visual representation of your site or mobile app
	2. They look like they are designed with wire
	3. They are meant to show the organization of site or app
		1. Layout of where everything goes
	4. Think of them as website placeholders
		1. They use common elements used across pages
	5. Sometimes color is used
		1. However, no graphic design
2. What is a prototype?
	1. It is actual simulation of what your app is meant to do
	2. It is a reduced version of the appliction you are going to build
		1. They are meant to look as close as possible to the application or idea
	3. How's it different?
		1. Some level of graphic design is done
			1. Some custom graphic elements
		2. It has interactivity - some of the actual interactivity
		3. We can click and tap things
			1. We can explore sitemap
	4. It is a surface level demo
		1. No heavy lifting
			1. No background calculation
			2. No saving information
			3. No creation of user account
3. What's a mockup?
	1. Describes both
		1. If we sketch - mockup
		2. Prototope - mockup

### High fidelity and low fidelity ###
1. Fidelity
	1. It means accuracy 
	2. How accurate is the mockup to what we are going to build at the end
	3. Low fidelity = low accuracy
	4. Wireframes - low fidelity
		1. Concerned only with layout - only organization
		2. No button design, color, ...
		3. Lacks graphic detail
	5. Prototypes - high fidelity
		1. Use design
		2. Some level of interactivity built into it
		3. Very close to the real website or app
2. Two different uses
	1. Low fidelity
		1. To just convey an idea
		2. To wrap around your head around a site or idea
		3. Accurate way of getting an estimation
		4. To approach a designer
			1. They determine the look and feel
		5. Developer only needs this type
		6. It doesn't give any information about the design or interactivity of the site
		7. Takes significantly less time
			1. We can crank out one in 30 minutes and do well
		8. Less money
			1. Only subscription for the tool
		9. Less pre-thought and less pre-planning
			1. Less detail and less to think about
	2. High fidelity
		1. If our site/app has a lot of calculations, buttons, things that move around, and a complex design, go for this for estimation
			1. If going for low fidelity, give verbal description of how the interactivity is going to be and how complex the design is going to be
			2. Complex interactions can mean big money
				1. Increases hours to build the high fidelity mockup
		2. It can be time consuming
			1. A lot more thought
				1. What happens during interactions
				2. Design - hire someone
		3. It needs more money
			1. $50 for templates
			2. High amount for designers
		4. Required when the viewer has higher standards
			1. To simulate a real product
			2. The viewer has higher standard of acceptance
				1. More real
				2. More polished
				3. More professional
			3. Examples: Investor, Pre-Sale, Pitch a client, Pitch to a project manager

### Understanding why we use wireframes and prototypes ###
1. Two reasons
	1. Internal communication (anyone in org)
		1. Cofounder, developer, designer, ...
		2. We need accurate timelines for any new product or feature launch
			1. We don't want any bombs to explode on us later
			2. We want to know what it's going to take and how long it's going to take
		3. We want to articulate what exactly we want to change or add
			1. Example: Photo album feature
		4. Is it important?
		5. Does it break anything?
		6. Developer Communication
			1. How do you explain to a developer
		7. Designer Communication
			1. Is it a lightbox?
			2. Is it a modal?
			3. Does it load on the page?
			4. Separate page?
			5. What does it look like?
		8. Pre-approval if we wanted to do something
			1. We need group on board
			2. They cannot take it seriously otherwise
	2. External Communication
		1. Deals with anyone not part of your organization.
		2. In business ecosystem
			1. Customers
			2. Clients
			3. Investors
			4. Outside design firms
			5. Outside development firms
			6. Consultants
			7. Contractors
			8. ...
		3. Prototype enables them to give authentic feedback and authentic responses from them
			1. Just description makes is harder to understand sometimes
				1. It is hard to explain apps in words
		4. Costing with prototypes
			1. If we show them exactly what we need, it is easy to time compare and price compare
				1. We can also estimate time and cost and compare
	3. Pitching investors
		1. Investors invest in ideas that have not yet been built
			1. You want to stick out
				1. If we show them
					1. They might understand and remember
	4. Pitching enterprise clients (or customers)
		1. They cannot exactly understand what you are trying to sell them
			1. They also might have bosses
				1. Verbal communication doesn't work
					1. Use prototypes instead (they don't get watered down)
	5. Validating ideas
		1. To prevalidate ideas
			1. Are the ideas fundable?
			2. Are the ideas purchasable?
			3. Are the ideas good?
		2. Prototype helps you to recruit other people to work with you

### Picking a tool ###
1. Tools
	1. Too many
		1. They basically do the same thing
		2. Some focus on low fidelity
		3. Some prototype focus
		4. Some both
	2. Examples:
		1. Axure
		2. iPlotz
		3. balsamiq
			1. Only low fidelity
			2. Easiest to use
			3. Clients like it
		4. HotGloo
		5. Visio
		6. Sketch
		8. ...
		9. Pidoco
			1. Widest feature set
			2. Cheaper than balsamiq
			3. Reason:
				1. Wireframes evolve into prototypes with interactivity
					1. It is better to keep them in the same application
			4. It's not free
	3. Look for feature coverage
		1. Wireframes
		2. Graphics
		3. Interactivity
		4. Connects pages
	4. Look for something that allows you to be able to share (important)
		1. Friends
		2. Colleagues
		3. ...
		4. (for better final product)
	5. find one that is deployable
		1. Does the tool allow you to publish it online and load it as a website?
			1. You want it to operate in the final environment it will be used in
				1. Real feedback
				2. More authentic
		2. We must be able to put it on phone
		3. Example: Flinto, ...
	6. Don't make wireframes on PhotoShop
		1. Hard to use
		2. Expensive
	7. Keynote
		1. Powerpoint
		2. Presentation put hot links to connect different pages
			1. Needs Keynotopia (costs money)

### Important things to understand beforehand ###
1. Wireframing
	1. KISS
		1. KISS + don't be lazy
			1. Don't include too much information
			2. Don't be lazy
				1. When we show it to designer
					1. The problem with being literal
						1. Don't skip details
					2. Avoid the middle fidelity trap
						1. Make first page well and skip details in about page say
							1. They might make it fit like what they think it should be (project management mistake)
				2. Solution: Be as detailed as possible but recognize when you are adding complexity that is not helpful for your product and not helpful for the entire process
					1. Designing over and over is redundant but simple

### Following the construction path ###
1. Framework for wireframing:
	1. Construction flow:
		1. **Strategy** (high level overview - big, broad, vague questions)
			1. What's the "point" of your app?
				1. What does it do - once sentence
			2. In one sentence, what does it do?
			3. What does the project accomplish?
				1. Example: List out products and sell them, and do them seamlessly and accommodate products and users
				2. Example: Happy hours - grabs your location and what food is around you during happy hours
					1. 20s and 30s look for happy hours
						1. Simple app
			4. OR What value does it deliver?
			5. Outline who you think will be using the application?
				1. What are user's needs?
					1. To buy?
					2. To buy and return?
					3. For information?
		2. **Scope**
			1. List out every functional requirement in your application
				1. Example: Weekly deals - capture email
			2. List every button, click event, email generated, etc you can think of
				1. Example:
					1. Login
					2. Guest access?
					3. Facebook connect?
						1. If using social information
			3. What situations does the app need to handle? Make sure you include functions & tools for that.
				1. Example:
					1. E-commerce
						1. Shipping wrong thing
				2. As admin:
					1. Keeping records of users
					2. Allow and disallow users
				3. Payments
					1. Stripe
					2. PayPal
			4. Include everything essential in the beginning
				1. Prioritize them and group them into important and not so important
		3. **Structure**
			1. What does the page look like from a mile away? (layout)
				1. Traditional?
				2. Blog style?
			2. Get in the groove by using a pen/paper and sketching it
			3. Grab "comparable" sites and use layouts you like
				1. How most people do it.
					1. Content websites for content website
					2. ...
					3. It's better to follow convention
				2. Examples:
					1. Zero - for enterprise software
					2. SaaS - for SaaS sites
		4. **Skeleton**
			1. It's Wireframe. Low fidelity mockup
			2. This is the part where you start wireraming process
			3. Focus on detail beyond layout. Shapes, sizes, text, etc.
				1. Actual pieces and elements
			4. Difference:	
				1. Layout: Labeling sections
				2. Skeleton: Actual elements and where they go
		5. **Surface** (pixels)
			1. This is the graphic design phase
				1. Visual design for the application
				2. High fidelity prototype
	2. The more time you spend, the more you get out of the process

### Section 1 review material ###

## Section 2: Coming up with details ##
### Coming up with a strategy ###

		2. More like a polished low fidelity wireframe
	5. Surface
		1. Get skeleton professionally designed
			1. What options do we have?
	6. Prototype
		1. It has interactions
2. Example:
	1. Our idea: Mobile app for finding Happy Hours
		1. Mocktails
	2. Tagline: Happy hours on your phone, now
	3. Strategy: (high level, simple, vague)
		1. Mobile application. Nob mobile web, it's a native application
		2. People want to find happy hours but it is difficult to use yelp. The options available are limited and a mobile solution could be better.
			1. Hypothesis
		3. Users: 
			1. 20-30 year olds going out in groups
			2. Couples going on dates
			3. After work groups looking for post day chatter
		4. Goals:
			1. Be able to find a happy hour in close proximity, within 5 minutes of opening the app
			2. Be able to quickly tell the prices of all the happy hours listed
			3. See visual reprentation of the happy hours on a map near me
			4. Be able to deals for tomorrow as well.

### Coming up with the scope ###
1. Scope:
	1. Client can make it 3-4 pages
		1. Every piece of detail
		2. Dos and don'ts
			1. Account for login
				1. For smaller versions of the app
					1. To avoid complexity
	2. Example:
		1. Do not need to collect user information and instantiate accounts
		2. Starts with a landing page of visual graphics
			1. Loading screen or paged loaded
				1. Page loaded - welcome screen
			2. "Find happy hours now"
		3. First page has two tappable buttons "For right now", "For tomorrow"
		4. App displays location pin (asks for your location information) where the user is
		5. Within last screen, show icon for happy hours that qualify within 2 miles
			1. We need to define what qualify mean - needs backend and an algorithm
		6. On map screen, be able to change radius of search/display
			1. Drop down button
				1. They like you to hold their hand through the process
					1. Don't give them so many options that they could get it wrong
		7. Click icon, will display a page about the business.
			1. Business information page:
				1. Cover photo of business
				2. On clicking cover photo, we see a photo album of space pictures
				3. What are the happy hours
				4. Location phone number
				5. List happy hour prices
					1. If user searched for tomorrow, then display at the top "Tomorrow"
				6. Button for bookmarking favorite place - can drop now
					1. Hard to save in the mobile phone
		8. Administration panel (not required for pitching and showing to clients)
			1. Uploading content
				1. Photos
				2. Text
				3. ...
			2. Ability to define new businesses
			3. Ability to add photos to new businesses
