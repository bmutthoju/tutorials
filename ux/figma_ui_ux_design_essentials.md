	2. High-Fidelity mockups: Looks exactly like the website with interactivity
4. It does enough for testing - we can make some observations and test some theories about what we think what the users want. If things need to be changed, we can change really quickly. It is about rapid prototyping. Quick changes. Until we are satisfied with it (user testing)
	1. Clients
